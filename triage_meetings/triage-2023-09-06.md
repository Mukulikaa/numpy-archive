## Follow up from previous meetings


- Defaulting to NEP 50 and [PR 23912](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/23912)
  - Weak scalars need to stay as weak integers deep into functions. This is complicated for things like percentile/quantile.
  - ufuncs can have weird casting semantics.

- Rewiring integers:
  - Could make the DTypes subclasses (`LongLongDType(Int64DType)`)
  - Special instances would be similar, but maybe harder because you can't mirror that in the scalars?

- Go over [1.26 tagged issues](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%221.26.0+release%22)

- NEP 52 Issues:
    - A discussion about NumPy's main namespace refactor. In a comment https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/24306#issuecomment-1663564574 there's a "tentative" list and it needs to be decieded if these items should be removed from `np` namespace or kept. 

- NEP 52 PRs:
    - NumPy main namespace cleanup "Part 3" PR needs an additional review: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/24376
    - `core/_type_aliases.py` refactor PR needs an additional review: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/24411
    - NumPy main namespace cleanup "Part 4" PR needs an additional review: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/24445

- `f2py` and `python 3.12`
  - Would be nice to have some of the [open PRs](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pulls?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Apr+label%3A%22component%3A+numpy.f2py%22) in
      - I suggest these:
          - https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/22657 - merged
          - https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/23282
          - https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/24299 - merged
  - There are GSoC PRs on `meson` support
      - https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/21923
      - https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/22225 - closed, updated in #24532
      - These need a rebase (minimally)
  - These have some bitrot
      - The idea was to hold on to `distutils` for a while longer and _optionally_ provide the `meson` variants

## New topics

- Raghuveer: PR review: Re-write 16-bit qsort dispatch
    - https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/24498

- mattip: PR review: Restore `np.broadcast` for Cython3.0 (seems OK) and add getter functions (can we not do this?) https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/24658
