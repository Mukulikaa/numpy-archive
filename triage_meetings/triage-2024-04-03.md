## Follow up from previous meetings 

- Review [milestone 2.0 label](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/milestone/118), maybe push off some of the items

## New topics
- Inessa: DEP: deprecate np.dtype(None) https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/23119 (we had discussed this at two previous triage meetings, and there is a slight preference for putting it in. But the PR has bitrotted a bit, let's wait till it is mergable and then put it in)
- Logic failure in CPU feature detection at build time https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/26151 (mattip)
- Use `visibility(hidden)` https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/26103 (mattip)
- Inquiry on Slack about the status of universal intrinsics implementation.
  - We will get RISCV support as we move more inner loops to Highway. We do have RISCV in our CI. There are some crashes on PPC and Arm8 in current Highway PRs. We can try to add sin/cos RISCV highway implemetations to see if it works.
