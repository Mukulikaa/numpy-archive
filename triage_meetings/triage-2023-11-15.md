## Follow up from previous meetings


- Rewiring integers:
  - Could make the DTypes subclasses (`LongLongDType(Int64DType)`)
  - Special instances would be similar, but maybe harder because you can't mirror that in the scalars?
  - Sebastian will open an issue so we can prioritize this.

- Take a look at the milestones for 2.0 https://github.com/orgs/numpy/projects/9

- Make the dtype API public (remove the "experimental" label) for 2.0


## New topics

- Zoom meeting access changed a bit.

- Array API for NumPy PRs need reviewing (9 PRs)

- Specific question w.r.t. to the array api PRs:
  - Array API has vecdot, which behaves quite different (no conj, and our one ravels). (Actually, both do conj).
  - Let's just stick with `np.True_` for now as repr.
  - asarray copy kwarg (Sebastians take mostly):
    - True/None/False should be OK?  We never deprecated this, which might be a problem (hopefully not?!).
      - It would be good to search for `np.array(..., copy=False)` briefly.  In most cases, it is probably unaffected, but could mutate siglthly.
    - the `__array__` dunder needs reviewing, because it might return a copy or a view (not sure this is accounted for).  For the buffer protocol, that is possible, but I think assuming a view is OK.

- After bumping NPY_MAXDIMS, we may want to review some static arrays, should we:
  - Try to use normal allocations (with the cache)
  - Use `alloca()` (i.e. in ufuncs which never have absurd number of arguments for the time being)?
  - ...?

- gh-25152, can we find a way to allow "default" arguments in ufuncs (support `None` to be special for an argument).


- Discuss gh-25009 (stop supporting `promotion_state` other than NEP 50).
