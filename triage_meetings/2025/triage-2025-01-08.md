## Follow up from previous meetings


## New topics

- Typing seems to have settled down. The big problem with `float64` scalar and ndarray mixing is fixed. The problem with reassigning a value is also fixed in a newer version of MyPy. The [documention](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/typing.html) could use a note about the MyPy/pyright problems.

- Should we remove/deprecate the MyPy plugin?
  - plugin magically defines e.g. intp to be int32 or int64 (depending on platform).
  - Already went a bit into that direction, and maybe yes: intp as an input makes some sense.  But accepting intp for a function that takes int64 is always wrong (since it will be on some platforms)
  - Let's see if we can put a nice DeprecationWarning.

- Nathan will look at TSAN CI. We don't want a very long CI job on every PR so if it's slow he will also look at CI that runs on a cron job and opens issues when it fails.


## Action items

- Matti will look into the manilinux transition eventually.

- Joren: Look into deprecation warning
