## Follow up from previous meetings

- Matti will look into the manilinux transition eventually.

- Unique nan PR: need to read through it

- Unique with hash PR should be converging, so may put it in soon (once the exception handling are ).



## New topics

- Discuss non-contiguous matmul speed up PR
  - There are some nice speed-up plots.
  - Code seems mostly done (maybe look into how the copy is done)
  - It may make sense to skip this branch (but likely we have a 2x slowdown worst case).
  - Benchmarks should be added.

- Chuck is aiming to release 2.2.2 on Sunday, February 9th
