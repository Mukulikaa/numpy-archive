## Follow up from previous meetings
 
- [name=inessa] Presentation topics for NumPy Newcomersâ€™ Hour 
To suggest a topic for future presentations, please leave a comment in this tracking issue: https://github.com/numpy/archive/issues/58.

- Sayed: Introducing new environment variable `NPY_FLOAT_PRECISION`  to change float precision at the runtime accepts three values `HIGH` : 1ULP or fallback to standards (libm), `MEDIUM` : 3.5ULP (Default), `LOW`:  lower than or equal to MEDIUM
  - Sayed will ping the mailing list with the proposal

- FP16 from SVML could be adopted or translated to universal intrinsics. 
Discussion: Check if Sayed is available to help move this forward. Raghuveer is happy to offer his insight, but has limited bandwidth.

- Inessa: ENH: drop dtype metadata: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/23371


## New topics

* Blockers for NumPy 1.25 branching (normally would be in about 3 weeks):
  - C-API compat would be good, but is on track
  - meson work may be a blocker?
    Is openblas 64 supported in meson?
  - https://github.com/mesonbuild/meson/pull/10921#issuecomment-1515103127 we will miss the 1.25 branching probably (and maybe first release), but this is fine.

* Triage review: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/10615
[x] Sebastian will finalize it.

* NumPy 1.24.x should happen really soon (maybe next weekend).
Sebastian will try to look into the weird masked array fallout continuation. 

- Inessa: MAINT: Extend unit tests test_ones and test_zeros #23580: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/23580
