## Follow up from previous meetings
 
- [name=inessa] Presentation topics for NumPy Newcomersâ€™ Hour 
To suggest a topic for future presentations, please leave a comment in this tracking issue: https://github.com/numpy/archive/issues/58.

- Do we want to add SLEEF? Do we want to include a new git submodule for AVX512 code? So far it includes routines for `sort()` https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/22315
  - Sayed: it might not be all that much faster
  - Does it handle exceptions? 
  - more maintenance burden
  - No proper support for warnings/exceptions would be an issue likely.

- Ganesh: [Low Priority] ENH: Added bitwise_count UFuncs: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/21429
    - AI Ganesh: Take a look more at the Array API specification to get a solid name on the function

- AVX12 sorting [PR](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/22315)


## New topics

- Inessa: Triaging issues related to creating arrays with regularly-spaced values.

- Inessa: ENH: Add a helper function to convert to array or scalar: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/8681
Decision: leaning towards closing it.

- Inessa: MAINT, DOC: get rid of unicode, unicode_, string_: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/20064
Decision: it's safe to remove unicode now.

- Inessa: Initial sort() by support and complex sort() change: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/16700
Decision: closing
