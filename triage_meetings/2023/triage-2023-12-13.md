## Follow up from previous meetings


- Take a look at the milestones for 2.0 https://github.com/orgs/numpy/projects/9


- Specific question w.r.t. to the array api PRs:
  - **[NEW]** `copy` keyword with new meaning for `False` (never copy vs. copy only if needed) will be added to `np.array` and `np.asarray`. Should `ndarray.astype(copy=...)` keep existing meaning `False/True` or adopt new `None/False/True`. Keeping original meaning will make it less consistent, but new meaning will cause quite a lot of churn.

- The number of open PRs keeps rising. 
  - Need attention: f2py, array-api, docs 

- @seberg: [array-converter](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/24214)
  - interesting line with linspace: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/24214/files#diff-a04184ba9eb050d7b56e631194fbd75bf323055f95704979f4971370e599701fR132



## New topics

- Triage PRs on `np.quantile` bugs and polynomial performance (https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pulls/eendebakpt, feel free to move to next meeting, I cannot join this time).

- Discussion with `__array_wrap__` and scalars:
  - Could introduce `return_scalar=True`, if that fails, deprecationwarning + call without.  Most downstream will have to update quickly.

- The current status of NEP-54
