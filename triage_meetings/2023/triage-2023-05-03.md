* [Inactive PRs](https://github.com/orgs/numpy/projects/6)


## Follow up from previous meetings
 
- [name=inessa] Presentation topics for NumPy Newcomers’ Hour 
To suggest a topic for future presentations, please leave a comment in this tracking issue: https://github.com/numpy/archive/issues/58.

- FP16 from SVML could be adopted or translated to universal intrinsics. 
Discussion: Check if Sayed is available to help move this forward. Raghuveer is happy to offer his insight, but has limited bandwidth.

* Blockers for NumPy 1.25 branching (normally would be in about 3 weeks):
  - C-API compat would be good, but is on track
  - meson work may be a blocker?
    Is openblas 64 supported in meson?
    Is SIMD supported in meson?
  - https://github.com/mesonbuild/meson/pull/10921#issuecomment-1515103127 we will miss the 1.25 branching probably (and maybe first release), but this is fine.


## New topics

- sin/cos precision fallout: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/23399?
  - Better coefficients exist, maybe could be taken from SVML, but a more precise version is in work even.
  - Not worry for now and if we can improve it do it.

- Raghuveer: sorting improvements in one place slow down benchmarks in an unrelated place https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/23435
Sayed will look into it.

- sub-byte dtypes https://github.com/numpy/numpy-user-dtypes/issues/63

- Inessa: MAINT: Extend unit tests test_ones and test_zeros: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/23580

- Inessa: DOC: Fix a typo in description and add an example of np.tensordot(): https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/23547

- May 9, 11:00am–1:00pm EDT [Python Distribution & Packaging Roundtable](https://hopin.com/events/python-distribution-packaging-roundtable-20230509/registration?utm_campaign=ot-event-20230509&utm_content=20230509-py-dist-pack-rt&utm_medium=network&utm_source=inessa) hosted by OpenTeams 


## Action items

- [ ] Inessa will send an announcement on the mailing list
