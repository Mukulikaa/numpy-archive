## Follow up from previous meetings
 
- [name=inessa] Presentation topics for NumPy Newcomersâ€™ Hour 
To suggest a topic for future presentations, please leave a comment in this tracking issue: https://github.com/numpy/archive/issues/58.

- Triage review list: ENH: loadtxt with non-matching number of fields in dtype:
https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/6388
Decision: Sebastian will finalize it (I didn't remember that we said this :), but can do)

- Triage review list: BUG: (closes #4352) any and all applied to object arrays should return bool: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/11857
  - Sebastian will ping the mailing list that we will probably give this a shot soon (or very similiar to the PR, Sebastian is unclear why the `None` path exists)


## New topics

- [name=seberg] Can we push the identity PR forward? https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/20970
  - Matti will try to review this week

- What does everyone think about giving a warning (due to slow speed) when loading an `npy` file written in Python 2. [PR](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/22916)?
  - OK, lets keep the warning.

- Explain mode of NumPy?
  - runtime overhead in ufuncs seem too high.

- Discussion about ufunc loop fusion (Sayed's thoughts)
  - Not JITting like numba (which is slower)
  - Have scalar/nuclear kernel functions (without stack(?)) and compose new loops from those.
  - Gives "fused" loops
  - https://www.weld.rs/weldnumpy/

- Inessa: NumPy policy "Contributor to core developer pathway"
Case studies: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fwMo7NKiHs_luGizbvTd9HBTqg714IFEgCXX6QW5HU0/edit?usp=sharing

- Inessa:  MAINT: Don't always make full copies in (arg)searchsorted: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/16942
Q: close it as the work discussed is carried out in other PRs.
A: no, it seems worthwhile.

- Inessa: Raise warning when condition number is too high?: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/3755
  - Added a comment asking for help
