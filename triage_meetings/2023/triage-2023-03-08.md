## Follow up from previous meetings
 
- [name=inessa] Presentation topics for NumPy Newcomersâ€™ Hour 
To suggest a topic for future presentations, please leave a comment in this tracking issue: https://github.com/numpy/archive/issues/58.

- Inessa: NumPy 2.0 team meeting will be held on April 3rd (time to be confirmed).

- Inessa: dot between the same two vectors should use nrm2: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/11768
Raghuveer will review the issue and make a final decision whether to close it or fix.

- Inessa: DOC: What is the purpose of fill_value in masked arrays?: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/20850
Matti will follow up.


## New topics

- Sayed: Introducing new environment variable `NPY_FLOAT_PRECISION`  to change float precision at the runtime accepts three values `HIGH` : 1ULP or fallback to standards (libm), `MEDIUM` : 3.5ULP (Default), `LOW`:  lower than or equal to MEDIUM
  - Sayed will ping the mailing list with the proposal

- FP16 from SVML could be adopted or translated to universal intrinsics. 

- Inessa:  numpy aborts on import due to OpenBLAS using too much memory: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/17856
Closing.

- Inessa: Unexpected output from arange with dtype=int: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/16159
Discussion: the proposed solution isn't feasible. Overall, the issue is pretty complex and hard to fix.

- Inessa: DEP: deprecate np.dtype(None): https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/23119
Sebastian will review it.

- Matti: Busyday count documentation and implemenation do not match https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/23197
Discussion: it's a misfit for the NumPy codebase, but since it's already there, we should fix it.


## Action items

- Ganesh: [Low Priority] ENH: Added bitwise_count UFuncs: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/21429
    - AI Ganesh: Take a look more at the Array API specification to get a solid name on the function
