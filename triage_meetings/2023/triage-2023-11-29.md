## Follow up from previous meetings


- Take a look at the milestones for 2.0 https://github.com/orgs/numpy/projects/9


- Specific question w.r.t. to the array api PRs:
  - Array API has vecdot, which behaves quite different (no conj, and our one ravels). (Actually, both do conj).
  - Let's just stick with `np.True_` for now as repr. [completed]
  - asarray copy kwarg (Sebastians take mostly):
    - True/None/False should be OK?  We never deprecated this, which might be a problem (hopefully not?!).
      - It would be good to search for `np.array(..., copy=False)` briefly.  In most cases, it is probably unaffected, but could mutate siglthly.
    - the `__array__` dunder needs reviewing, because it might return a copy or a view (not sure this is accounted for).  For the buffer protocol, that is possible, but I think assuming a view is OK.


## New topics


- The number of open PRs keeps rising. 
  - Need attention: f2py, array-api,docs 

- @mdhaber: [gh-24978](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/24978)

- @seberg: [array-converter](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/24214)
  - interesting line with linspace: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/24214/files#diff-a04184ba9eb050d7b56e631194fbd75bf323055f95704979f4971370e599701fR132

- Recent test failures pypy+cygwin:
  - small pypy issue, but could just add a check on our side as well.
  - Cygwin started universally failing today: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/25273
