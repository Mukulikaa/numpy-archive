## Follow up from previous meetings
 
- [name=inessa] Presentation topics for NumPy Newcomersâ€™ Hour 
To suggest a topic for future presentations, please leave a comment in this tracking issue: https://github.com/numpy/archive/issues/58.


## New topics

- Nathan Goldbaum: [Adding a `_is_numeric` attribute](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/23190), the last comment on the PR summarizes the situation so far. [name=mattip] This would be used as `type(array.dtype)._is_numeric`
  The need is "this dtype can be handled as a number" vs. "this dtype cannot be handled as a number". This will simplify the dtype.kind probing that many libraries do. One of these is OK, but if we need more, we need a more generic design. We could also add a np.dinfo(dtype) function that would return a dictionary of attributes.
  - Decided to keep going to unblock, even if all the concernse have a good point.

- Inessa: NumPy 2.0 team meeting planning
Suggestion from Ralf: 
> I'd prefer virtual, in-person is too difficult logistically. April is far enough away that any date, weekend or weekday, should work for me. 
> Format: how about something like 4 hours, with 30-45 minutes per main topic for the release. With 5-15 minutes of each slot for the development lead on that topic to present their plan, and the rest for discussion?
> Participants: invites to all maintainers, regular contributors and folks involved in a 2.0 roadmap topic. And the meeting being open for listening in for anyone else who is interested.

Feedback from the meeting participants: The green light to the proposed timeframes and format. Inessa will share a poll to pick a date in April for the meeting.

- [name=mattip] Adding a `state` or `module` to API functions in NumPy 2.0. Could we do this with two different API exporting mechanisms?

- Inessa: dot between the same two vectors should use nrm2: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/11768
Raghuveer will review the issue and make a final decision whether to close it or fix.

- Chuck: ENH: Add ndmax param for numpy.array: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/16667

- Inessa: DOC: What is the purpose of fill_value in masked arrays?: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/20850
Matti will follow up.

- Chuck: BUG: SWIG overloaded long functions on pyfragments.swg will seg fault: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/16604


## Action items

- Ganesh: [Low Priority] ENH: Added bitwise_count UFuncs: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/21429
    - AI Ganesh: Take a look more at the Array API specification to get a solid name on the function
