## Follow up from previous meetings
 
- [name=inessa] Presentation topics for NumPy Newcomers’ Hour 
To suggest a topic for future presentations, please leave a comment in this tracking issue: https://github.com/numpy/archive/issues/58.

- Inessa: NumPy 2.0 meeting - Monday, April 3rd, 3 - 7pm UTC
Meeting format: 4 hours in total, 30-45 minutes per main topic for the release. Everyone is welcome to listen in.
Meeting agenda: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vNDBlnVCJM-Nv7xF02Re4qk_5rR9uAUi0ih6K3b2YAE/edit?usp=sharing

- Sayed: Introducing new environment variable `NPY_FLOAT_PRECISION`  to change float precision at the runtime accepts three values `HIGH` : 1ULP or fallback to standards (libm), `MEDIUM` : 3.5ULP (Default), `LOW`:  lower than or equal to MEDIUM
  - Sayed will ping the mailing list with the proposal

- FP16 from SVML could be adopted or translated to universal intrinsics. 
Discussion: Check if Sayed is available to help move this forward. Raghuveer is happy to offer his insight, but has limited bandwidth.



## New topics

- Inessa: higher allocation of CI runners 
Permanent, at the org level

- Inessa: Newcomers sprints schedule for 2023
**Confirmed** NumPy mentored sprint at PyCon US’23 (in person). 
  - Saturday, Apr 22nd; exact time TBD, but likely afternoon (US)
For details about the event, visit: https://us.pycon.org/2023/events/mentored-sprints/.
Sign up as a mentor here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IZKuxwbBWf-KDT29dcW2yrrdzXbKrwY12LzvvFf9cpo/edit?usp=sharing
**Invited:** https://ghc.anitab.org/programs-and-awards/open-source-day/
We are looking for 2-3 sprints hosts.

- Inessa: ENH: vectorized histogram with axis keyword https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/13166
Chuck: move all the histogram related code to a dedicated submodule?
It would help with numpy/numpy/lib/ cleanup.

- dot between the same two vectors should use nrm2: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/11768
Closing.

- API: No timedelta/datetimes are not integers and do not promote: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/22568
Sebastian (the author of the PR): better suited for NumPy 2.0



## Action items

[x] Ganesh: [Low Priority] ENH: Added bitwise_count UFuncs: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/21429
Take a look more at the Array API specification to get a solid name on the function
