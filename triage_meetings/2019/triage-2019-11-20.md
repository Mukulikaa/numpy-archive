## Follow-up from last meeting / discussions

- Upcoming developer sprint (22/23 Nov). All contributors welcome.
  - [Agenda for sprint](https://hackmd.io/t06nCEAfSJ6DhPnkhlUDRg?view) (work in progress)

- NumFOCUS and MSDSE Summit summary and debriefing
  - [Matti's draft blog post](https://hackmd.io/WgPCz_MSRi-OmPtx09WWjA), Ralf and he will discuss it further

# Topics

- Status of PowerPC CI and support, and SIMD support bounty
  - s390x big-endian machines are now available on travis
  - [PR](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/13516) in progress, renamed and Matti started review

- [Milestones](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/milestone/69) for 1.18 release
  - What are the important items for this release (may not be in the milestones)?
  - Add some files with the highlights tag to `doc/release/upcoming_changes`
  - write a mail to the list about the C-API refactor: moving and making it more accessible
      - point to Cython headers, docs for easy review

- [Issue](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/4519) with Fortran `character(len=*)` from 2014 - should we raise the priority of fixing it?
  - While this particular issue is low priority, we should encourage work on `f2py`. Maybe make a tracking issue to organize the `f2py` issues.
      - [Initial attempt at tracking issue](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/14938)
  - Is there a demand for modernizing `f2py` and its documentation?  Is there anyone available to mentor/help a newcomer do this?

- [Milestones](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/milestone/78) for 1.17.5 release
  - [metadata in dtype](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/14142)
    - For 1.17.5 raise an error when saving. For 1.18 - figure out a solution.

- Progress on numpy.org web site
  - Added translations
  - Content is being filled in


## Additional Details

- Matti
  - numpy.random c-api refactor is merged. [PR for the C side](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/14604) is ready including documenting the functions in `_generator.pyx` 
  - Started reviewing the SIMD optimizations.
  - manylinux2014 supports s390x, power64le, aarch64. Tried to get multibuild working as well

- Warren
  - Worked on Matti's PR to remove the use of Accelerate in Mac OSX.  Still need to resolve the correct way to do this.
  - Pinged the contributor of an old PR to fix how the Dirichlet distribution handles small parameters, which led to a new PR.  Learned about the "stick breaking" method for generating random Dirichlet variates.  Reviewed the new PR.

- Sebastian
    - Start thinking about cleaning up ArrFuncs (fasttake/putmask slots)
    - Other slots argmax, compare, nonzero may or may not make sense as ufuncs (topic for saturday maybe)
    - Pandas is discussing how to handle their new NA, it may be nice to keep things synched up (maybe have a single NA scalar live in NumPy even, etc.)
