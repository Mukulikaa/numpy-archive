**This meeting will focus on Issue and Pull Request Triage**

## Topics

- Discuss meeting format & triage labels
    - Split meeting notes into two files
    - Sebastian & Matti will focus on this meeting Stéfan & Ralf on community
    - Issues to discuss: things that need broader input or opinions.
    - Prioritization of issues.
    - Meeting requires preparation: there is not enough time in the meeting to get up to speed with in depth detail of any issue.
    - <what Ralf said></what>
    - Maintainers can apply label; that maintained can then provide context during the meeting.
    - "Triaged" label applied to issues that have gone through triage process

- [Triage-review issues](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/labels/Triage-review) and [PRs](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen+is%3Apr+label%3ATriage-review+)

  - Ragged arrays: revert for now, to unbreak CI failures of all downstream projects. Then reintroduce as soon as possible. There's some discussion around reverting, since it doesn't "feel good". It's just a workflow thing though, most people agree with the change, it just needs cleaning up downstream first *and* addressing the NumPy issues (is it still possible to write generic code?). We _will_ put it in again.

    - https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/15833
    - https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/pull/30035

- [PRs labeled with "needs decision"](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pulls?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Apr+label%3A%2254+-+Needs+decision%22)
- [genfromtxt issues](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+genfromtxt): ~30 open issues, has been problematic for years
- [Install issues](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/labels/32%20-%20Installation): this is still a significant fraction of all reported issues, can we improve on this?
