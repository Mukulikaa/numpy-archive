# 2019-10-30 NumPy Development Meeting

- Time: 11am Pacific Time
- Join via Zoom at https://berkeley.zoom.us/j/762261535
- [Trello workboard](https://trello.com/b/Azg4fYZH/numpy-at-bids)
- [Previous meetings](https://github.com/numpy/archive/tree/master/status_meetings)

**Present:** StÃ©fan, Hameer, Warren, Chuck, Matti

## Follow-up from last meeting / discussions

- Upcoming developer sprint (22/23 Nov). All welcome, including doc and web teams.

- Parsing complex from string:
    - from file (needs approval): https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/14730
    - from string (approved, waiting for the above PR to merge together): https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/14227
    - there is also cpython's [complex_from_string_inner](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/1b53a24fb4417c764dd5933bce505f5c94249ca6/Objects/complexobject.c#L784) but it doesn't seem we can reuse it


# Topics

- Deprecate importing nose. It uses `import imp` which is deprecated, and is not maintained.

- Progess on richcompare. [The PR](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/14800) to change `OO->?` to `OO->O` on comparison ufuncs had little impact. It did not seem to change anything in SymPy (for instance) and required minimal changes to tests.
  - Try it in pandas
- SciPy build on CPython3.8 seemed to expose a [circular import](https://github.com/MacPython/scipy-wheels/pull/55#issuecomment-547767779). Fixed in [PR 14803](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/14803), do we want to backport it?
  - Chuck is open to 17.4, there might be more issues
  - Maybe someone could try on a macOS machine? 
- Recommended practices for calling polynomial. We should have a "best practices" tutorial. People should use the Polynomial class.
  - Add it to the sprint subjects

## Additional Details

- Matti
  - numpy.random c-api refactor
    - python side is done. [PR for the C side](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/14604) is ready including documenting the functions in `_generator.pyx`. It exposed python3.7 deprecation warnings in setuptools and numba.
  - handling `-std=c99` and other build cleanups (macOS, instantiating the ccompiler only once)
  - https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/577 object dtype richcompare does not break SymPY

- Warren
  - Fixed bug in `random.Generator.integers` method.
  - Repo for custom dtype experiments: https://github.com/WarrenWeckesser/numtypes. Expanding `nint32` to include a type for each signed integer type.  Next steps: port some of the dtypes in the `numtypes` repo to Sebastian's new code.
