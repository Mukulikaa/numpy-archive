# 2019-10-16 NumPy Development Meeting

- Time: 11am Pacific Time
- Join via Zoom at https://berkeley.zoom.us/j/762261535
- [Trello workboard](https://trello.com/b/Azg4fYZH/numpy-at-bids)
- [Previous meetings](https://github.com/numpy/archive/tree/master/status_meetings)

**Present:** Warren, ZJ, Sebastian, Ralf, Jonathan Helmus, Hameer, St√©fan, Mike Sarahan, Chuck


## Follow-up from last meeting / discussions

- [Draft NEP](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/14674) for dtype=object deprectation. Do always reject ragged array input, or develop a new interface for them or do something else?


* `numpy-financial`: Deprecation PR in NumPy is in progress.  We've decided to freeze the NumPy functions now, and move existing issues and PRs to the numpy-financial repo.


# Topics

- Guidelines for distribution of patched versions of NumPy (and other projects)
    - Two things: Intel had changes to sklearn; Anaconda distributing modified versions.
    - Create a NEP to write down some guidelines
    - Conda-forge largly unchanged (but some changes such as gfortran detection bugs)
    - Discourage re-use of NumPy trademark, encourage publishing of own package if API is extended
        - Using official override mechanisms OK (scipy.fft may, e.g., be gray area to explore)
    - Note that companies like Intel are also free to make patches that improves NumPy in general, e.g. proper AVX support
      - System for monkey patching after special import is option (`import intel_np_patch`), but community contribution clearly preferable


- "Spring Cleanup" sprint on Tues PDT 9:00-17:00


- Ideas to improve our API design process.
    - The end user/library impact is often neglected in NEPs but also PRs
    - Update NEP Template/NEP 0 and contributer guidelines (Hameer will start on this)


- Deprecation of `PyArray_GetArrayParamsFromObject`
    - Any chance we could decide on deprecation and removal (if no complaints) quickly?


- Adding a `--std=c99` [flag universally](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/14147): on the one hand it would be easy to add code like in runtests.py but on the other hand it may bite us down the road, and is only needed on old platforms which are close to end-of-life.
    - We should provide the flag when necessary.


## Additional Details

- Matti
  - numpy.random c-api refactor
    - waiting for OP response on [issue 14517](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/14517)
  - cython slow progress
  - (still need to check whether https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/577 object dtype richcompare behavior breaks SymPy)

- Sebastian
    - Tests work with UFuncs/GUfuncs (not reduce/accumulate)
    - `np.ma.masked` is the only test failure right now (not a big issue though)
    - Code cleanup up next...


- Warren

  - Tuesday sprint.
  - `numpy-financial` 0.2.0 released (will probably be the same as 1.0). Deprecation in NumPy is in progress.
  - Repo for dtype experiments: https://github.com/WarrenWeckesser/numtypes.  Experiments with a complex integer dtype (not pushed yet) brought up potential issues with the numpy array `real` and `imag` properties.

- Inessa

  - We need more [user stories](https://github.com/numpy/numpy.org/issues/42); (add a comment) if you have any features you'd like to see in the website, this would be a good way to provide it. "X is a user interested in looking up documentation from the latest stable release; they navigate to the front page, and in the shortest number of clicks find the current stable release docs", etc.
