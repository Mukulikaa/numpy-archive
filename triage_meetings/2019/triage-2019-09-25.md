# 2019-09-25 NumPy Development Meeting

- Time: 11am Pacific Time
- Join via Zoom at https://berkeley.zoom.us/j/762261535
- [Trello workboard](https://trello.com/b/Azg4fYZH/numpy-at-bids)
- [Previous meetings](https://github.com/numpy/archive/tree/master/status_meetings)

**Present:** Ralf, Hameer, Matti, Warren, Stéfan, Sebastian, Tyler, ZJ, Chuck, Anne B.


## Follow-up from last meeting / discussions


- Supporting low-level cython `pxd` routines from `random` as a public API [issue 14517](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/14517)
  - There is no plan/NEP/documented API
  - Get in touch with Robert to find out whether this was an intentionally supported use-case
      - Reached out on [mailing list thread](https://mail.python.org/pipermail/numpy-discussion/2019-September/080089.html), will follow up during the week
          - Robert responded; mainly Cython, will expose bit generators
  - https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/14562
    don't install partial C/Cython `random` API
    - Matti will review by EoD and merge

- Notes from these meetings and last year's BIDS report are now in numpy/archive. We should check the permissions needed for the hackmd.io integration before enabling it. Mailing list discussion.
    - https://github.com/numpy/archive
    - [BIDS report](https://github.com/BIDS-numpy/docs/tree/master/reports) as requested last week

- *NEP 32 - Remove financial functions.*
There has been one response on the PyData mailing list to my proposal to accept NEP 32:

    https://groups.google.com/d/msg/pydata/sf2wIiIZ6Ps/GOvN1jmsBAAJ

  The concern expressed there is legitimate, but the risk of "withering" support is known and has been disussed in the [github issue](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/2880).  We are willing to accept that risk.  I wouldn't call the one email a "substantive objection" (to use the NEP 0 terminology) that would prevent the NEP from being accepted.  Tomorrow I'll submit a pull request to change the status of the NEP to *Accepted*.  Then we can start work on creating the numpy-financial repository and deprecating the functions in NumPy.

- [NumPy User Stories](https://mail.python.org/pipermail/numpy-discussion/2019-September/080066.html) for https://numpy.org; please file new stories [on GitHub](https://github.com/numpy/numpy.org/issues/42)

- NumPy logo refresh [numpy.org#37](https://github.com/numpy/numpy.org/issues/37)
    - CZI grant proposal has funding allocated to a graphics designer; postpone this discussion until we hear back about those funds. Would also be better timing, since bulk of webdesign will be complete.


# Topics

- Publicizing the sprint Mon Nov 4 at the NumFocus Summit in NY (just before PyData NY)
  - This is _during_ PyData NYC and meant mostly for Summit attendees --> don't publish as a general sprint

- Sprint (22-23 Nov) agenda?
    - Data type redesign
    - Duckarray support (protocol/dispatching)
    - Vision for roadmap; preferably we could do some work upfront coming up with ideas
        - Current roadmap has only [scope](https://numpy.org/neps/scope.html), not vision section, so does not deal with future
    - Wheel building revision (move repo to numpy, update macos, )
    - [PR to scisprint repo](https://github.com/scisprints/scisprints/pull/6) with tentative topics
      - should add these ideas to the PR

- Deprecate automatic `dtype=object` array creation?
  - NEP needed? --> yes
  - Should try it with pandas, scipy, sympy
  - Ragged arrays may be an option to address specifically.
    - Not really worth the effort?
  - Integers are a subissue of this, Python integers can become "int64", "uint64" or "object" (on windows even more)

- DType call and progress
    - Sebastian's takeaway was that he had to make an example implementation including ufuncs.
    - He got array promotion to work more-or-less.
    - If datetimes work, not too much to add for units, since datatimes implicitly carry their own unit.
    - Unit test coverage pretty good for dtypes
        - You also need integration tests
    - How do we proceed with a big change like this, making sure we can integrate the work in the end?
        - Ralf describes SciPy situation, where e.g. Pauli refactored C calling interface—hard for other devs to put it all in their heads.  But if we can agree on higher level goals, and have good testing in place, then we can proceed.
        - We will do all changes/clean-ups we can beforehand in anticipation of the refactor; Sebastian is putting design in [proto-NEP](https://hackmd.io/kxuh15QGSjueEKft5SaMug); as we go along, we showcase portions of the code to probe for design flaws; experimental work is happening on Sebastian's public branch

- Repository permissions
  - Add a numpy-financial team (Sebastian will do this)

- PRs waiting for final review
  - https://github --> merged
  - https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/14585
    segfault in unravel
  - https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/14573
    remove private info files, needs a release note?
  - https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/14534
    remove dead code for clang warnings
  - https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/14583
    remove deprecated select behaviour
  - https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/14562
    remove partial C API for random number generators
  - https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/12633
    F2Py reference count fixups 

- (`OO->?` equality loop and `==` operator deprecation)

- I'd like to gently probe whether it would make sense to reconsider removing Matrix / factoring into subpackage / at a minimum, removing any special cases from core code (maybe now technically feasible because of other protocols and the @ operator); SciPy will eventually have to transition to array interface [Stéfan]
  - Preliminary support for CSC/CSR in PyData sparse,
    but we don't necessarily need to wait for that
  - There is an open issue for [scipy sparse](https://github.com/scipy/scipy/issues/8195)
  - General agreement that we will eventually deprecate it; we need a NEP to track all the details
      - May have to factor it out into an external package & vendor it in SciPy
  - Stéfan will start slowly getting together a NEP

## Additional Details

- Matti
  - removing expired deprecations; produces some rabbit holes
  - cython slow progress
  - https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/577 object dtype richcompare behavior

- Sebastian

- Warren
  - Catching up on `percentile` and `quantile` issues, for [percentile/quantile: allow specifying interpolation method](https://trello.com/c/hCo6o7kK/94-percentile-quantile-allow-specifying-interpolation-method).
  - Repo for ufunc experiments: https://github.com/WarrenWeckesser/npuff (the name might change!)
    Includes the ufunc `logfactorial` to compute the log of the factorial of an integer, and the function `ufunc_inspector` to print information about a ufunc, e.g.

    ```
    >>> ufunc_inspector(np.sqrt)
    'sqrt' is a ufunc.
    nin = 1, nout = 1, ntypes = 10
    loop types:
      0:   23 ->  23  (e->e)  PyUFunc_e_e_As_f_f
      1:   11 ->  11  (f->f)  not generic (or not in the checked generics)
      2:   12 ->  12  (d->d)  not generic (or not in the checked generics)
      3:   11 ->  11  (f->f)  PyUFunc_f_f
      4:   12 ->  12  (d->d)  PyUFunc_d_d
      5:   13 ->  13  (g->g)  PyUFunc_g_g
      6:   14 ->  14  (F->F)  PyUFunc_F_F
      7:   15 ->  15  (D->D)  PyUFunc_D_D
      8:   16 ->  16  (G->G)  PyUFunc_G_G
      9:   17 ->  17  (O->O)  PyUFunc_O_O_method
    ```

    The identification of the generic loops is something you can't (AFAIK) get from the existing public Python API.
    
  - Repo for my experiments with custom dtypes using the current API is https://github.com/WarrenWeckesser/numtypes
  - [Repo for notes about NumPy](https://github.com/WarrenWeckesser/numpy-notes)
    These notes will focus on using the NumPy C API.
