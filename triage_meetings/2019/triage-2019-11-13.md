## Follow-up from last meeting / discussions

- Upcoming developer sprint (22/23 Nov). All welcome, including doc and web teams.
  - [Agenda for sprint](https://hackmd.io/t06nCEAfSJ6DhPnkhlUDRg?view) (work in progress)


# Topics

- Status of PowerPC CI and support, and SIMD support bounty
  - s390x big-endian machines are now available on travis
  - [PR](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/13516) in progress, quite poorly named 

- [Milestones](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/milestone/69) for 1.18 release
  - What are the important items for this release (may not be in the milestones)?
  - Add some files wih the highlights tag to `doc/release/upcoming_changes`
  - help with the random refactor PR for 1.17

- NumFOCUS and MSDSE Summit summary and debriefing
  - Matti will draft a blog post and Ralf will flesh it out
  - Concern over what drives the direction of the projects: how do we determine where to go and how to decide?

- A `$$` topic

- Progress on richcompare. [The PR](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/14800) to change `OO->?` to `OO->O` on comparison ufuncs was reverted. It broke indexing a[a==0]. Ideas to overcome that? Maybe value-based casting of object->bool? We still do not have a good story for removing the deprecations from richcompare. Mattip hit this with the recent datetime64 ufunc updates as well.

- [Issue](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/4519) with Fortran `character(len=*)`from 2014 - should we raise the priority of fixing it?
  - While this particular issue is low priority, we should encourage work on `f2py`. Maybe make a tracking issue to organize the `f2py` issues.

- Adding distributions to `numpy.random`: what is in scope?  Two cases:
  - New pull request to add the "two-sided geometric distribution" (https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/14890)
  - Waren would like to see the negative hypergeometric distribution implemented (completes the family of binomial, negative binomial, hypergeometric, negative hypergeometric). 


## Additional Details

- Matti
  - numpy.random c-api refactor
  - python side is done. [PR for the C side](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/14604) is ready including documenting the functions in `_generator.pyx`.
  - Attended NumFocus summit and MSDSCE summit
  - datetime ufuncs
- Warren
  - SciPy sprint at PyData NYC, 11/4/2019 
  - ufunclab (https://github.com/WarrenWeckesser/ufunclab): added `min_argmin` and `max_argmax` gufuncs (simultaneous extreme value and index of extreme value).  These are examples of gufuncs that return more than one array.
  - numtypes (https://github.com/WarrenWeckesser/numtypes): added `polarcomplex64` and `polarcomplex128` NumPy custom dtypes. (Started a writing a tutorial for creating these to be put in https://github.com/WarrenWeckesser/numpy-notes, but nothing committed to github yet.)  These, and some other custom dtypes in this repository, will be my test cases for the new custom dtype interface.
