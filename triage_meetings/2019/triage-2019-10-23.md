# 2019-10-23 NumPy Development Meeting

- Time: 11am Pacific Time
- [Trello workboard](https://trello.com/b/Azg4fYZH/numpy-at-bids)
- [Previous meetings](https://github.com/numpy/archive/tree/master/status_meetings)

**Present:** Ralf, Hameer, Chuck, Matti, St√©fan, Zijie, Warren, 

## Follow-up from last meeting / discussions

- [Draft NEP](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/14674) for dtype=object deprecation. Do always reject ragged array input, or develop a new interface for them or do something else?
  - conclusion: we will not change the behaviour of the current `np.array(..., dtype=object)`, but will only deprecate automatic object array creation for ragged arrays.


* [`numpy-financial`](https://github.com/numpy/numpy-financial): release 1.0. Deprecations have been added to the functions in NumPy.  All open issues and pull requests in the NumPy repository have been closed.
  * add an announcement like the regular numpy releases (`python-announce@python.org`)

- Adding a `--std=c99` [flag universally](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/14147): on the one hand it would be easy to add code like in runtests.py but on the other hand it may bite us down the road, and is only needed on old platforms which are close to end-of-life.
    - We should provide the flag when necessary.
    - Matti will give it another try.

# Topics

- Upcoming developer sprint (22/23 Nov). All welcome, including doc and web teams.

- random include files should go to `numpy/core/include/numpy/random/*.h`. We should not expose any more of mtrand than we absolutely have to

- Outstanding PRs from "spring cleaning sprint":
    - from file (needs approval): https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/14730
    - from string (approved, waiting for the above PR to merge together): https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/14227



## Additional Details

- Matti
  - (Ralf: doc part also still not done)
  - numpy.random c-api refactor
    - python side is done. PR for the C side is almost ready. It exposed python3.7 deprecation warnings in setuptools and numba.
  - cython slow progress
  - (still need to check whether https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/577 object dtype richcompare behavior breaks SymPy)

- Sebastian
    - Tests work with UFuncs/GUfuncs (not reduce/accumulate)
    - `np.ma.masked` is the only test failure right now (not a big issue though)
    - Code cleanup up next...


- Warren

  - `numpy-financial` Symbolic release of 1.0.0.  Completed closing of NumPy issues and PRs that were tagged `numpy.lib.financial`.
  - `multivariate_hypergeometric` code updated to match the revised `random` file structure.  Merged :tada:.
  - Repo for ufunc experiments: https://github.com/WarrenWeckesser/ufunclab.  Finally dug into the type resolution code and  added handling of `datetime64` and `timedelta64` to the `peaktopeak` gufunc. `peaktopeak` is starting to look like a useful alternative to `ptp`. `peaktopeak` makes a single pass through the data.  For *some* arrays, `peaktopeak` is faster than `ptp`, but it isn't hard to create examples where `ptp` is faster--maybe because of chunking in the minimum and maximum ufuncs used by `ptp`?
  - Repo for custom dtype experiments: https://github.com/WarrenWeckesser/numtypes.  Added experimental `complex_int#` data types.  Doing so exposed an issue with NumPy array `.real` and `.imag` attributes.  These attributes  are dtype-specific, and probably shouldn't be part of the standard ndarray API.  Currently their behavior is hardcoded, which means complex-like custom dtypes such as `complex_int` or a hypothetical `polar_complex` can't override them nicely.  For a `polar_complex` dtype, `.real` and `.imag` would have to be computed properties instead of simple views.
