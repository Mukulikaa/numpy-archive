# 2019-10-09 NumPy Development Meeting

- Time: 11am Pacific Time
- Join via Zoom at https://berkeley.zoom.us/j/762261535
- [Trello workboard](https://trello.com/b/Azg4fYZH/numpy-at-bids)
- [Previous meetings](https://github.com/numpy/archive/tree/master/status_meetings)

**Present:** Matti, Hameer, Inessa, ZJ, Chuck, Warren, StÃ©fan, Sebastian


## Follow-up from last meeting / discussions

- Deprecate automatic `dtype=object` array creation?
  - NEP needed? --> yes

* Matrix Deprecation options:
    * Move into SciPy or separate package
        * Could have a hybrid vendor/use-if-external way to do it
    * Possible issue: If there are more then one package being used, they may not interact correctly
    * What about scikit-learn? We should check. Run their test suite? grep the code?
      (`isinstance()` checks could fail).

* MaskedArray replacement?
  - perhaps we could write a MaskedArray refactor based on `__array_function__` and `__array_ufunc__`. There was a start on this by ahaldane.
  - Pandas is discussing masked scalars, we should track and be active in design decisions.
        - Make sure to ping NumPy mailing list once the proposal is largely finished. (Sebastian)

* `numpy-financial`: 
   * Automated doc building on pushes to the [repo](https://github.com/numpy/numpy-financial) is up and running: https://numpy.org/numpy-financial/. Note: The content in that link will be reorganized soon.
   * PyPI account: https://pypi.org/project/numpy-financial/.  The one package already uploaded there is *not* an official release!
   * Next step is to set up another workflow or two to automate releases as much as possible.


# Topics

* Revisit type Hinting for NumPy?
    - Worth to catch up with numpy-stubs and talk to Stephan Hoyer about it. (briefly chat at Sprints)

* Code freeze financial (soon?) noting that bug fixes will only be applied in `numpy-financial`?
    - Once there is a package up on PyPI, we will institute a code freeze, and deprecate the current code
    - Also move issue over to new repository.

* NEP 31: Summarized Mailing List Discussions in NEP-31, along with responses.

* More user-stories to help web-development along [(issue)](https://github.com/numpy/numpy.org/issues/42).


## Additional Details

- Matti
  - numpy.random c-api refactor
    - look at [issue 14517](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/14517)
  - cython slow progress
  - numpy-wheels and cpython3.8, which percolates changes through manylinux and multibuild
  - (still need to check whether https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/577 object dtype richcompare behavior breaks SymPy)

- Sebastian
    - UFunc/GUfunc code (except 0D array behaviour/casting) mostly working
        - Only Numba usage should be broken (currently)
    - Next:
        - Add and test one "resolver" function, to support the `OO->?` and `OO->O` loops which otherwise are too similar.
        - Fix value based 0D array casting and add warnings (or machinery for it) when behaviour will change.
        - debugging...
    - Then: Update new-style inner-loop signature.

- Warren

  - The numpy-financial repository is in progress.
  - Repo for ufunc experiments: https://github.com/WarrenWeckesser/ufunclab (I have some work-in-progress here not yet pushed to github.)

- Inessa

  - We need more [user stories](https://github.com/numpy/numpy.org/issues/42); (add a comment) if you have any features you'd like to see in the website, this would be a good way to provide it. "X is a user interested in looking up documentation from the latest stable release; they navigate to the front page, and in the shortest number of clicks find the current stable release docs", etc.
