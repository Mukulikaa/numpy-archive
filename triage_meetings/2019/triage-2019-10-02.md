# 2019-10-02 NumPy Development Meeting

- Time: 11am Pacific Time
- Join via Zoom at https://berkeley.zoom.us/j/762261535
- [Trello workboard](https://trello.com/b/Azg4fYZH/numpy-at-bids)
- [Previous meetings](https://github.com/numpy/archive/tree/master/status_meetings)

**Present:** Matti, StÃ©fan, ZJ, Hameer, Warren, Sebastian, Kriti


## Follow-up from last meeting / discussions

- *NEP 32 - Remove financial functions.*
    - Repository created/in work

- Deprecate automatic `dtype=object` array creation?
  - NEP needed? --> yes

- Should the [numpy.org notes](https://github.com/numpy/archive/blob/master/status_meetings/website_status-2019-09-23.md) be archived differently? <-- worth keeping this entry? Not sure what exactly was being asked.

- Matrix deprecation

# Topics

* Matrix Deprecation options:
    * Move into SciPy or separate package
    * Possible issue: If there are more then one package being used, they may not interact correctly
      (`isinstance()` checks could fail).

* MaskedArray replacement?
  - perhaps we could write a MaskedArray refactor based on `__array_funtion__` and `__array_ufunc__`. There was a start on this by ahaldane.

* Looking into `np.matrix` move.
  - Looking into creating a separate package.


## Additional Details

- Matti
  - numpy.random c-api refactor
  - cython slow progress
  - https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/577 object dtype richcompare behavior
    - check whether a PR breaks SymPy

- Sebastian
    - Working on UFuncImpl and the ufunc dispatching
    - Multiple dispatching (very basic, but probably enough)

- Warren

  - The numpy-financial repository is in progress.  Short summary: *github actions/workflows for CI:* :smile:,  *Sphinx:* :anguished: 
  - Repo for ufunc experiments: https://github.com/WarrenWeckesser/ufunclab: Added the gufuncs `minmax` and `peaktopeak`.  Summary of recent experiences with the NumPy C API: *gufuncs:* :smile:,  *casting code:* :anguished: 
    
  - Repo for my experiments with custom dtypes using the current API is https://github.com/WarrenWeckesser/numtypes
