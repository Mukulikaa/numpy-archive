## Follow up from previous meetings


- Nathan: take temperature about a stringdtype NEP


## New topics

- Pluggable interface for inner loop functions rather than more and more specialized libraries (see [PR to use Highway](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/24018#issuecomment-1609265749)). Should we discuss this at a community meeting also?
  - Issues with highway:
    - Pretty much a duplicate of NumPy's universal intrinsics
    - Their math libs have an accuracy of 3ULP, but with the caveat of only valid on small ranges (at least for some?) 


- [Accelerate PR](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/24053)
  - Is the available accelerate safe on all MacOS versions we ship wheels for?
  - Is NumPy main the right place for the compatibility/dispatching shim? (doesn't at least SciPy also need it?)
