**Code of Conduct**
The NumPy Steering Council has made a strong commitment to creating an open, inclusive, and positive community. 
All attendees of NumPy community events must adhere to the NumPy Code of Conduct (https://numpy.org/code-of-conduct/). 
If you see violations, take a screenshot, intervene in a respectful manner, and report it to the CoC Committee via email. For more information, refer to the Reporting Guidelines section on https://numpy.org/code-of-conduct/.

**Present**: Matti, Chuck, Tyler, Sebastian, Inessa, Sayed, Nathan
 
## Follow up from previous meetings

- Sebastian: Looking into cleaning out buffering (reduce but not just reduce)...  The one change, I think is needed is reducing the buffer-size up to half size.
  (I think that is fine, since it is unlikely you always get buffer-size sized chunks, since it would require the array to be a multiple of that size...)
  - Matti will set up a time to go over it and review together with Sebastian.


## New topics

- Build and upload documentation for 2.2
  - Discussion on Slack: https://numpy-team.slack.com/archives/CM8C6PE67/p1733919588780059
  - Matti will take a look.

- Should we move to a newer `manylinux_2_28` (RHEL 8 based).
  - Amazon support may be one thing to keep in mind (which glibc they support): Amazon linux 2 would not be supported and that is supported until June 25.
  - Seems we don't have to worry about Amazon, as it is EOL about the same time as NumPy 2.3 will be released.
  - One thing to check when we make this move: can we remove some of the blocklisted trig functions?
