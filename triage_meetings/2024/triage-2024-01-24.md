## Follow up from previous meetings


- Take a look at the milestones for 2.0 https://github.com/orgs/numpy/projects/9


- Specific question w.r.t. to the array api PRs:
  - **[NEW]** `copy` keyword with new meaning for `False` (never copy vs. copy only if needed) will be added to `np.array` and `np.asarray`. Should `ndarray.astype(copy=...)` keep existing meaning `False/True` or adopt new `None/False/True`. Keeping original meaning will make it less consistent, but new meaning will cause quite a lot of churn.


- Triage PRs on `np.quantile` bugs and polynomial performance (https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pulls/eendebakpt, feel free to move to next meeting, I cannot join this time).



## New topics

- Exposing new DType API: Have to skip the DTypeMeta in the limited API. Can use `#ifndef Py_LIMITED_API`

- NEP 54 discussion in optimization meeting:
    - Need time to evaluate still and make a decision.  (Raghuveer and Chris need to review the custom alternative)
