## Follow up from previous meetings 

- Review [milestone 2.0 label](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/milestone/118), maybe push off some of the items. It seems 2.1 will follow quickly after 2.0

- Chuck: should we increase the line length to 85 characters?
  - We discussed this. There was a concensus around 88 chars. There is a `.clang-format` file that can enforce this, should it replace the c style guide? 


## New topics

- All the things for release date
  - PRs/issues: reviewed, all good, no blockers for Sunday :rocket: 
  - blog post: we discussed the plan and took notes on https://hackmd.io/o46wXoj1TDyqokW4NVHEZQ


- doctest-plus/scipy-doctest or refguide-check? [discussion]() -> in favor to merge this. naming: we voted, let's name it `check-docs` and merge it :rocket:
- `set_string_function` https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/26611
