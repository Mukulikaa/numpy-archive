## Follow up from previous meetings 

- Review [milestone 2.0 label](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/milestone/118), maybe push off some of the items. It seems 2.1 will follow quickly after 2.0

- [When histogramming data with integer dtype, force bin width >= 1](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/12150)

## New topics
- Inessa: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/25616

- Ben: Doc related: Internal link consistency? 
  - Single backticks will generate a single cross-ref
  - Removing double backticks on internal functions is a good idea
  - Don't batch too many files at a time

- NASA ROSES grant: ideas for new work

- Chuck: should we increase the line length to 85 characters?
