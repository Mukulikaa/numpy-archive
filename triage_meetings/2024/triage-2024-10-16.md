## Follow up from previous meetings

- ndimensional `trim` [PR ](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/15181). Lars, the author, came to explain the PR. Discussion:
  - Last meeting, we decided to go ahead. There were reqeusts for some documentation about what "front" and "back" mean and why `0` is special. The PR has been updated and is ready for final review


- Next 2.1.x probably next weekend

- Discussion on endorsing SPEC 1: https://scientific-python.org/specs/spec-0001/
   - Sebastian, Chuck, Stefan, and Inessa are in support of endorsing it.
   - The random and linalg submodules could be potential use cases; but NumPy already makes modules directly available, so only need to consider if there are import time concerns.
   - Inessa will propose SPECs 1, 6, 7, 8 for the review by the Steering Council and Sebastian - on the mailing list

- Show shape in repr ([gh](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/27482), [mailing list](https://mail.python.org/archives/list/numpy-discussion@python.org/thread/QFLT4Z4ZVSTUPEYNYRS5BZILTNCMWMNN/))

- Style cleanups PRs:
  - Chuck wants to push them forward, but split them up.

## New topics

- Talked about SPEC discussion on the mailing list, it seems that endorsing most of them are uncontroversial.

- [name=Adrin] (not hopefully this is the right place to put it). It'd be nice if I could get some insight into this issue: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/26018#discussion_r1771824129
