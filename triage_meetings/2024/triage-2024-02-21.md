## Follow up from previous meetings

- Review the milestones for 2.0 https://github.com/orgs/numpy/projects/9
  - Still open: Arrary API [tracking issue](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/25076), string dtype (should be merged soon), dtype C API (should be done by the end of next week?) 
  - We should add string versions of copy [PR 25168 ](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/25168)

- Triage PRs on `np.quantile` bugs and polynomial performance (https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pulls/eendebakpt, feel free to move to next meeting, I cannot join this time).

## New topics
- Proposal to adopt JSON-NTV, the extended JSON format: https://mail.python.org/archives/list/numpy-discussion@python.org/message/CCKQKHIF6H5AAYCBPAGQ3DQB22MDEGMV/
   - related GH issue: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/12481
   - We don't have strong reasons to support it.
   - It could ride on top of DLPack, but what do we do with the data pointer (one of the advantages of DLPack).
   - Questions to ask the authors: performance and size limitations.
   - Matti will respond via the mailing list once it is available.

- Should `np.array()` call `__array__()` with a `copy` keyword? 
  https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/25168#issuecomment-1956255657 
  `np.array(a, copy=...)` internally: `a.__array__(copy=...)`
