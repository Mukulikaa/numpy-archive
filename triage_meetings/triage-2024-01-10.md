## Follow up from previous meetings


- Take a look at the milestones for 2.0 https://github.com/orgs/numpy/projects/9


- Specific question w.r.t. to the array api PRs:
  - **[NEW]** `copy` keyword with new meaning for `False` (never copy vs. copy only if needed) will be added to `np.array` and `np.asarray`. Should `ndarray.astype(copy=...)` keep existing meaning `False/True` or adopt new `None/False/True`. Keeping original meaning will make it less consistent, but new meaning will cause quite a lot of churn.


- Triage PRs on `np.quantile` bugs and polynomial performance (https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pulls/eendebakpt, feel free to move to next meeting, I cannot join this time).


## New topics

- Limited API in headers is only tricky due to `PyArrayScalar_VAL` which takes the `obval` field in the header.
   - We could get rid of it
   - Or guard it with limited API
   - Nathan: There are some user, so conensus is guard seems simpler

- Discussion about NEP 54/highway adoption
  - There was some discussion about how to add the PowerPC and IBMZ quicksort, since it is broken on the latest Highway release [PR 25563](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/25563), but using `main` is broken differently. This should be fixed in Highway.
  - Since NEP 54 recommends using Sayed's templated C++ code, we should try to review and merge [PR 21057](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/21057).

- Triage review: [BUG: Fix return shape of inverse_indices in unique_inverse](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/25553):
  - The `inverse` part of `unique` is not reshaped as expected.
  - Should we fix this (arguably a BC break, but does the old even make sense)?  Or only fix the new API?
