## Follow up from previous meetings


- Defaulting to NEP 50 and [PR 23912](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/23912)
  - Weak scalars need to stay as weak integers deep into functions. This is complicated for things like percentile/quantile.
  - ufuncs can have weird casting semantics.

- A namespace for utilities [Issue 24166](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/24166)
  - `lib.array_utils` seems like a winner

- Rewiring integers:
  - Could make the DTypes subclasses (`LongLongDType(Int64DType)`)
  - Special instances would be similar, but maybe harder because you can't mirror that in the scalars?


## New topics

- Getting 1.26 done:
    - rc isn't really blocked on meson work (which will allow downstream to build wheels for Python 3.12)
    - versioneer work needs to be done
    - pretty good shape, but still a few days.

- Go over tagged issues

- Discussion on building docs for 1.26
