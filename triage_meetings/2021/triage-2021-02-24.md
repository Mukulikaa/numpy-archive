## Topics

- `numpy.lib` namespace?
  - The `from numpy.lib import *` is probably not important to keep around.
  - `np.lib.stride_tricks.broadcast_to` will also be hidden/go away?
  - Lets just start with cleaning it up a bit for now.

- pnumpy is getting some use

- new manylinux is going up, which may allow us to drop some of our blocklist glibc.


- M1 status: 

- NumPy 1.20.2 release end of the month.

- Lets try to triage next week: Label accordingly!
