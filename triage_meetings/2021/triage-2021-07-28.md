# 2021-07-28 NumPy Development Meeting -- Triage

Note: we alternate between [community meetings](https://hackmd.io/76o-IxCjQX2mOXO_wwkcpg) and triage meetings.

- Time: 9am Pacific Time
- Join via Zoom at https://berkeley.zoom.us/j/762261535 (or [dial-in](https://berkeley.zoom.us/u/aC3ENhycM))
- [Trello workboard](https://trello.com/b/Azg4fYZH/numpy-at-bids)
- [Previous community meetings](https://github.com/numpy/archive/tree/master/status_meetings)
- [Previous triage meetings](https://github.com/numpy/archive/tree/master/triage_meetings)


**Present:** Ross, Aaron, Bas, Chuck, Sebastian, Matti


## Array API
Aaron presented the Array API PR. The idea is that you have to deliberitely import it in order to use it.

* The idea is to now not use a leading underscore (to make transition easier)

* Probably still go with warning on import (or env variable)

* Spec status:
  * current still slightly in flux (mostly in parts like linalg)
  * no version yet, but its specified

* Testing:
  * Tests currently focus on things that is not in the "array API" test suite 
  * It would be nice to have CI for array-api tests.
  * The full tests are slow (around 10 minutes)
  * For now running it even on data-api project would seem fine
  * Testing is not a problem *right now*, we can move forward, add a CI job as follow up.

* Right now test suite is failing due to older Pythons not support positional-only arguments
  * Run linter in 3.8 should make things work




## CI

* We should move away from python3.7 as our base version

* We should make sure the linter does not stop CI workflows on failure



## Triage

* [PRs and issues labelled with "Triage-Review"](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/labels/Triage-review) (please add)

* [PRs and issues labeled with "needs decision"](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/labels/54%20-%20Needs%20decision) (50 open)

* [Open PRs (>250 open)](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pulls) can we get this below 200?

* Ross' list of cross-referenced issues: https://rossbar.github.io/github_graphql/index.html


## Followup
 


## Topics

- Moving forward with the [data-api's Array PR](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/18585)

- We should stop blocking CI on linter warnings.

- We could probably bump up 3.8 as minimum Python version (would help with the array API due to positional only arguments).  Probably, drop it for 1.23.
