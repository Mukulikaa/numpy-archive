## Followup
 


## Topics

* Adding `__class_getitem__` to `ndarray` and `dtype`
    - Python 3.9 introduced [`types.GenericAlias`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/types.html#types.GenericAlias) for this purpose (see [PEP 585](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0585/))
  * It is just a Python dunder method, which can be added (the implementation can be in Python `_methods.py`) and raise a type error on old Python versions.

* SciPy Sprint?
  - No real plans to do it, it was never a big event in any case

* Modulo/divmod warnings: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/19316
  - Regressing for macos seems fine to us as a try (its not our problem)

* Data allocation NEP: Merge next step

* NEP 43 work, Sebastian and Matti will meet on it.
