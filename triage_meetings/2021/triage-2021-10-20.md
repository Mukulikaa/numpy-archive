## Triage

* [PRs and issues labelled with "Triage-Review"](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/labels/Triage-review) (please add)

* [PRs and issues labeled with "needs decision"](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/labels/54%20-%20Needs%20decision) (50 open)

* [Open PRs (>250 open)](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pulls) can we get this below 200?


## Followup



## Topics

* Merge [cibuildwheel PR](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/20102)?
  
  concerns: 
  - how do we trigger a build for a tag?
  - how do we trigger the workflow for an arbitrary branch if we want to create wheels
  - how can we limit who can trigger such builds?
  - We still need a setup for travis for arm64, ppc64le, s390x

  maybe we should keep this in Macpython/numpy-wheels? 
  Conclusion: we might want to wait until after the release of 1.22 to mess with this.
  
* 1.22.x fork will be in about 3 weeks.

* We need to add SVML to sdist before the next release.

* Merge C++ demo PR?
  Conclusion: let's merge it. That way we can see if it is harmful in 1.22 before going too deeply into refactoring all the loops.

* What to do about travis? Should we check out drone.io?
  - Arm jobs are failing pretty regularly right now
  - Pandas uses circleci for arm64
  - https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/arm-resources/#overview 

* Prioritize division bug for 1.21.3? https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/20025
  - [Other issues?](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues?q=is:open+is:issue+milestone:%221.21.3+release%22)
