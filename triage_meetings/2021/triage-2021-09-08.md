- Join via Zoom at https://berkeley.zoom.us/j/762261535 (or [dial-in](https://berkeley.zoom.us/u/aC3ENhycM))
- [Trello workboard](https://trello.com/b/Azg4fYZH/numpy-at-bids)
- [Previous community meetings](https://github.com/numpy/archive/tree/master/status_meetings)
- [Previous triage meetings](https://github.com/numpy/archive/tree/master/triage_meetings)


**Present:** Tyler, Chuck, Sebastian, Bas


## Triage

* [PRs and issues labelled with "Triage-Review"](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/labels/Triage-review) (please add)

* [PRs and issues labeled with "needs decision"](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/labels/54%20-%20Needs%20decision) (50 open)

* [Open PRs (>250 open)](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pulls) can we get this below 200?

* Ross' list of cross-referenced issues: https://rossbar.github.io/github_graphql/index.html


## Followup

* Revisit a PR that we've triaged before: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/16221
  - See if there's a straightforward way to handle the compressed formats in the Python std lib

* C++ proposal, but probably a dicussion for the community meeting? --> yes (I/Ralf put it on, but missed that the time of this meeting had shifted - Serge and I both cannot make it today)


## Topics

* Disable "Approve and run" for first-time contributors?
  - Setting is in the "Actions" tab of the settings.  Changed to the lower "first contribution and recently joined github".

* Import guard PR changes:
  * Sebastian will browse through and merge after the meeting.


* Old PR review (Sebastian and Chuck):
  - https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/4987
  - https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/5457 (close because Matti's PR replaces it)
  - https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/5470 (close because Matti's PR replaces it)
  - https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/5508 view generalization: We can ask to bring it up again since it is not finished.
  - https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/5930 convert to issue (feature request)
  - https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/6222 Close (issue exists).  We should probably wait for a new sort implementation rather than tagging on c_metadata like this.  The reverse parameter seems good though.
  - https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/8211 (Sebastian: I agree with Eric, will close and encourage to start discussion again to add `covmat=` parameter to `corrcoef` only)
