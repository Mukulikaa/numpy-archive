## Topics


- Should we reschedule based on UTC or just move the time?
  - I will ask Matti what works for him


- NumPy 1.20.2
  - Do we have a schedule/goal? Probably end of the week.
  - Cleaning up the warning-flag issue/mod slow down would seem nice (I have not started on it yet, though).  Anything more?  We will not make this a blocker for 1.20.2


- Discussed SPECs effort briefly: https://scientific-python.org/
