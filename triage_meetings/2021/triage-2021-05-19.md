# 2021-05-19 NumPy Development Meeting -- Triage

Note: we alternate between [community meetings](https://hackmd.io/76o-IxCjQX2mOXO_wwkcpg) and triage meetings.

- Time: 11am Pacific Time
- Join via Zoom at https://berkeley.zoom.us/j/762261535 (or [dial-in](https://berkeley.zoom.us/u/aC3ENhycM))
- [Trello workboard](https://trello.com/b/Azg4fYZH/numpy-at-bids)
- [Previous community meetings](https://github.com/numpy/archive/tree/master/status_meetings)
- [Previous triage meetings](https://github.com/numpy/archive/tree/master/triage_meetings)


**Present:** Matti, Ross, Hameer, Sebastian, Stphannie, Chuck


## Triage

* [PRs and issues labelled with "Triage-Review"](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/labels/Triage-review) (please add)

* [PRs and issues labeled with "needs decision"](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/labels/54%20-%20Needs%20decision) (50 open)

* [Open PRs (>235 open)](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pulls) can we get this below 200?

* Ross' list of cross-referenced issues: https://rossbar.github.io/github_graphql/index.html


## Followup

* Quantile methods and weights discussion.
  - Weights may not depend on the "methods"
  - We should try to resolve the "method" problem, which probably means one of us has to start the deprecation process.  The current default and "H&F" should be obvious, beyond that maybe we can wait for new contributors.
      - Try to ping @chunweiyuan maybe we can get them to do this step? (Matti will ping, if nothing happens we can discuss again next time)



## Topics

- Travis build timeout?
    - Seems just to be flukes, and we can restart...

- The correct `smallest_normal` for IBM double-double.
    - Its hard to define these values correctly: Make it a NaN, since its hard... And if someone complains, they can fix it :).

- Allocator and ufunc refactor/maintanence: Can't make it into NumpY 1.21, there is too many variables/review needed.

- Pre 1.21. triage, remaining issues and PRs.
    - NEP 35: Should be properly accepted and the "experimental warnings" removed. (Sebastian)
    - Sebastian: The clang compiler flag should happen.
    - Sebastian: Will think about the PR that fixed warnings for some ufuncs (but may have started adding a bit too much, to make them work the same everywhere.)

- `np.equal.reduce([1, 2, 3])` -> `np.equal.reduce([True, True, True])` compared to `reduce(operator.eq, [1, 2, 3])`  `True == 1` -> `True == 2`. `np.equal.reduce([1, 2, 3], dtype=object)`.
    - I could now fix very easily that `np.all([None])` returns boolean, but by changing `np.logical_and.reduce([None])` to also return booleans.  Forcing the user to type `dtype=object`.
