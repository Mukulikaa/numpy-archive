- Join via Zoom at https://berkeley.zoom.us/j/762261535 (or [dial-in](https://berkeley.zoom.us/u/aC3ENhycM))
- [Trello workboard](https://trello.com/b/Azg4fYZH/numpy-at-bids)
- [Previous community meetings](https://github.com/numpy/archive/tree/master/status_meetings)
- [Previous triage meetings](https://github.com/numpy/archive/tree/master/triage_meetings)


**Present:** Ross, Sebastian, Chuck, Bas


## Triage

* [PRs and issues labelled with "Triage-Review"](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/labels/Triage-review) (please add)

* [PRs and issues labeled with "needs decision"](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/labels/54%20-%20Needs%20decision) (50 open)

* [Open PRs (>250 open)](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pulls) can we get this below 200?

* Ross' list of cross-referenced issues: https://rossbar.github.io/github_graphql/index.html


## Followup

- GCC 11 problems (do we have to open a GCC issue?)
    - About time to open a GCC issue about the speculative execution in complex division(?) (0-branch is executed when it should not be) – Chuck can open this one
    - Infinite loop: Ping Sayed, but if he doesn't know, also open an issue as well. – Ross will deal with this one.

- We can contact ping the apple dev's who looked at the accelerate/m1 things
  - (We could also purchase hardware, the only question is where to put it if we want to have CI runners) 


## Topics

* Add C-API `PyArray_ArgMinWithKeepdims` and `PyArray_ArgMaxKeepdims`?
  - No problem, I guess ping the list in case someone is opposed.


* NumPy 1.21 release seems pretty good, but a few bugs that need a 1.21.1

* We should try to knock down the PR list a bit:
  - The LGTM PR can be finished up
  - There is one cleaning up signature and just needs style fixes. (Sebastian)
  - argmax/agmin+keepdims: Sebastian will send mail, and then it is good enough to go in I think
