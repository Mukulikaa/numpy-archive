## Followup



## Topics

* Sayed had this interesting/tricky/impressive results into digging into the `exp(0)` + MKL bug: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/20356#issuecomment-970716796 should we do and backport that?
  - Let it sit for a bit, should probably make sure to get it in the next release/backported.


- `np.float128` - let's deprecate the name and leave `np.longdouble`. At some point we may be able to deprecate `np.longdouble`
