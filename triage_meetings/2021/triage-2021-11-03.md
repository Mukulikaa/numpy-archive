# 2021-11-03 NumPy Development Meeting -- Triage

Note: we alternate between [community meetings](https://hackmd.io/76o-IxCjQX2mOXO_wwkcpg) and triage meetings.

- Time: 16:30 UTC (9:30am Pacific Time)
- Join via Zoom at https://berkeley.zoom.us/j/762261535 (or [dial-in](https://berkeley.zoom.us/u/aC3ENhycM))
- [Previous community meetings](https://github.com/numpy/archive/tree/master/status_meetings)
- [Previous triage meetings](https://github.com/numpy/archive/tree/master/triage_meetings)


**Present:** Chuck, Tyler, Sebastian, Matti, Ross


## Triage

* [PRs and issues labelled with "Triage-Review"](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/labels/Triage-review) (please add)

* [PRs and issues labeled with "needs decision"](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/labels/54%20-%20Needs%20decision) (50 open)

* [Open PRs (>250 open)](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pulls) can we get this below 200?


## Followup



## Topics



* Marked for triage review, can we put these in now and improve them going forward?:
  * [dlpack](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/19083)
  * [copy enum with NEVER](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/19173)
    * My main worry is `obj.__array__()` normally returns a copy, so `np.array(obj, copy=NEVER)` should always error because we do not control `obj.__array__`.
    * Two possible fixes:
      * 1. `PyArray_FromAny`, reject any array for which `cache->arr_or_sequence != cache->converted_obj`. Within the block after `if (cache != NULL && !(cache->sequence)) {`  (This would be too late if we want to never call `__array__()`!)
      * 2. Pass the flag into `PyArray_DiscoverDTypeAndShape` and reject there (or indicate there) that a copy may have happened  (alternatively, just always indicate if a copy may have happened; This would also be too late!). Via `_array_from_array_like`.  Need to pass in the flag and reject `__array__` (array-interface is fine, buffer interface can maybe be assumed to be fine).

* New allocator API, do we need some ["future proofing"]?(https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/20193#issuecomment-952224199)
  - Version (that should be 0 or 1 now or so)
  - `void *reserved1`, etc. slots that should be NULL but could be defined?

* Percentile: Put in now? (Sebastian) Try followup with `method` keyword argument before release?
