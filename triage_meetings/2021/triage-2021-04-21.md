- Ross' list of cross-referenced issues: https://rossbar.github.io/github_graphql/index.html


## Followup

- We need more release managers (knowledgeable persons)


## Topics

- Quantile methods and weights discussion.
  - Weights may not depend on the "methods"
  - We should try to resolve the "method" problem, which probably means one of us has to start the deprecation process.  The current default and "H&F" should be obvious, beyond that maybe we can wait for new contributors.
      - Try to ping @chunweiyuan maybe we can get them to do this step? (Matti will ping, if nothing happens we can discuss again next time)

- Adding support for Doxygen via Breathe (sphinx extension)
  - https://breathe.readthedocs.io/en/latest
  - Should document inside the code with doxygen style, then create second PR to try the serving using breathe.
  - There is some concern about it being heavy or lists a huge amount of templated versions that tend to be distracting.

- Sebastian would like a review on this: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/18676

- Sebastian has to review the 0 power PR!
