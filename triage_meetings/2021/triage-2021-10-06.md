# 2021-10-06 NumPy Development Meeting -- Triage

Note: we alternate between [community meetings](https://hackmd.io/76o-IxCjQX2mOXO_wwkcpg) and triage meetings.

- Time: 9am Pacific Time
- Join via Zoom at https://berkeley.zoom.us/j/762261535 (or [dial-in](https://berkeley.zoom.us/u/aC3ENhycM))
- [Previous community meetings](https://github.com/numpy/archive/tree/master/status_meetings)
- [Previous triage meetings](https://github.com/numpy/archive/tree/master/triage_meetings)


**Present:** Rohit, Abel, Serge, Bas, Ross, Sebastian, Chuck, Tyler, Matti


## Triage

* [PRs and issues labelled with "Triage-Review"](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/labels/Triage-review) (please add)

* [PRs and issues labeled with "needs decision"](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/labels/54%20-%20Needs%20decision) (50 open)

* [Open PRs (>250 open)](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pulls) can we get this below 200?


## Followup

* C++ proposal, but probably a dicussion for the community meeting (discussed a bit at community meeting, Serge was there.)
  * We should limit C++ explicitly, we can have clang-tidy
  * One possibility for how C++ might sneak in/allow: [xsimd](https://github.com/xtensor-stack/xsimd)
  * We should try the current approach, maybe still a brief code review, but otherwise this should go in for the next release.

## Topics

* [percentile refactor](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/19857) â€“ Abel is planning to join
  - Doc CI is currently broken (Chuck will have a look after squashing)
  - Sebastian: Write to the mailing list about the new API choices.

* [Choose extension PR](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/20001)
  - Close, we might be able to fix the existing function.

* [Signature modification to searchsorted](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/19982) close?
  - Just close it. 

* configurable allocator
  How concerned are we about changing the size of PyArrayObject?
  - Sebastian wants manual OWNDATA=True flag setting to fall back to system `free` to keep old code working.

* SVML: Matti will look at the PR this week.
