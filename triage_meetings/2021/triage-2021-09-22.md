# 2021-09-22 NumPy Development Meeting -- Triage

Note: we alternate between [community meetings](https://hackmd.io/76o-IxCjQX2mOXO_wwkcpg) and triage meetings.

- Time: 9am Pacific Time
- Join via Zoom at https://berkeley.zoom.us/j/762261535 (or [dial-in](https://berkeley.zoom.us/u/aC3ENhycM))
- [Previous community meetings](https://github.com/numpy/archive/tree/master/status_meetings)
- [Previous triage meetings](https://github.com/numpy/archive/tree/master/triage_meetings)


**Present:** Rohit, Sebastian, Chuck, Ross, Tyler, Bas


## Triage

* [PRs and issues labelled with "Triage-Review"](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/labels/Triage-review) (please add)

* [PRs and issues labeled with "needs decision"](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/labels/54%20-%20Needs%20decision) (50 open)

* [Open PRs (>250 open)](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pulls) can we get this below 200?

* Ross' list of cross-referenced issues: https://rossbar.github.io/github_graphql/index.html


## Followup

* C++ proposal, but probably a dicussion for the community meeting (discussed a bit at community meeting, Serge was there.)
  * We should limit C++ explicitly, we can have clang-tidy
  * One possibility for how C++ might sneak in/allow: [xsimd](https://github.com/xtensor-stack/xsimd)


## Topics

* Move Community meeting to this time slot?

* [percentile refactor](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/19857): expose an `Enum` with the various `interpolation` kinds? Which namespace?
  * We tend against an enum, but don't seem to have strong opinions :).  We have a preference to not have both, which probably means strings?
  * We can rename the keyword argument in a followup.
  * Percentile changes: Check copyright again just to be sure.
  * Just get it over with :)

* `npreadtext`
  - **current** incompatibilities (see [issues](https://github.com/BIDS-numpy/npreadtext/issues)):
    - float hex parsing, some odder parsing e.g. embedded `_` in `100_000` (_could_ be fixed)
    - Some errors change (generally _more_ informative though)
    - Stranger things, like ignoring embedded `\n` characters within a line in a list (could be changed)
  - Lower priority to followup on the python enhancements.
  - Better tests is probably the biggest chunk left to work off...
    - Julia+pandas may have some tests

* A couple of triage-review issues open
