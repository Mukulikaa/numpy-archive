# 2021-06-16 NumPy Development Meeting -- Triage

Note: we alternate between [community meetings](https://hackmd.io/76o-IxCjQX2mOXO_wwkcpg) and triage meetings.

- Time: 11am Pacific Time
- Join via Zoom at https://berkeley.zoom.us/j/762261535 (or [dial-in](https://berkeley.zoom.us/u/aC3ENhycM))
- [Trello workboard](https://trello.com/b/Azg4fYZH/numpy-at-bids)
- [Previous community meetings](https://github.com/numpy/archive/tree/master/status_meetings)
- [Previous triage meetings](https://github.com/numpy/archive/tree/master/triage_meetings)


**Present:** Hameer, Ross, Chuck, Aflonso, Bas, Matti, Sebastian


## Triage

* [PRs and issues labelled with "Triage-Review"](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/labels/Triage-review) (please add)

* [PRs and issues labeled with "needs decision"](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/labels/54%20-%20Needs%20decision) (50 open)

* [Open PRs (>235 open)](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pulls) can we get this below 200?

* Ross' list of cross-referenced issues: https://rossbar.github.io/github_graphql/index.html


## Followup

- 1.22 release:
  - 64bit BLAS, will be ready go
  - DTypes, should have full experimental exposure in that release  
  - Accept the "like" NEP and document that it is done  (Sebastian: Will do a PR and send a note that it "has been accepted" to the list) – and then backport
  - Value-based promotion: Will try to deprecate it around the time of the 1.21 release (or soon after) – there is no branch for this yet (or there is, but it was an old quick try by @seberg)




## Topics

- GCC 11 is currently creating some issues (one may be due to SIMD.  But others at least warning flags, are related to GCC probably)

- PEPs for typing arithmetic (Literal[1] -> 1, Plus -> +)
  - Somewhat related discussion to the `Literal` issue on typing-sig: typing of singletons.
      -  https://mail.python.org/archives/list/typing-sig@python.org/thread/NDEJ7UCDPINP634GXWDARVMTGDVSNBKV/
  - There seems to be interest in using Type Arithmetic in Numpy so we will send an email to typing-sig and numpy-discussion to get started the discussion on a PEP for supporting type arithmetic.
  - It would be great if Numpy folks could attend any Tensor Typing Meeting (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oaG0V2ZE5BRDjd9N-Tr1N0IKGwZQcraIlZ0N8ayqVg8/edit#)

- We can contact ping the apple dev's who looked at the accelerate/m1 things
  - (We could also purchase hardware, the only question is where to put it if we want to have CI runners)
