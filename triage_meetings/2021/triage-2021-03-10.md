Note: we alternate between [community meetings](https://hackmd.io/76o-IxCjQX2mOXO_wwkcpg) and triage meetings.

- Time: 11am Pacific Time
- Join via Zoom at https://berkeley.zoom.us/j/762261535 (or [dial-in](https://berkeley.zoom.us/u/aC3ENhycM))
- [Trello workboard](https://trello.com/b/Azg4fYZH/numpy-at-bids)
- [Previous community meetings](https://github.com/numpy/archive/tree/master/status_meetings)
- [Previous triage meetings](https://github.com/numpy/archive/tree/master/triage_meetings)


**Present:** Chuck, Matti, Ross, Sebastian, Aaron Meurer


## Triage

- [PRs and issues labelled with "Triage-Review"](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/labels/Triage-review) (3 open, please add)

- [PRs and issues labeled with "needs decision"](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/labels/54%20-%20Needs%20decision) (50 open)

- [Open PRs (>250 open)](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pulls) can we get this below 200?

## Topics

* NEP 47 Implementation PR: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/18585
  * We probably need Ralf to get a final opinion on this.  Aaron will get together with Ralf and organize another meeting if necessary.

* SymPy+dill issue: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/18547

- "Future Weak dtypes" with respect to comparisons (tagged as triage-review as well)
  
* Promotion, promotion, promotion...
    - Can we get agreement that we want to (hopefully) move towards "weak promotion" for py-scalars (and strong promotion for NumPy scalars)
    - In that case, is it OK if I basically do:
        - New code path.
        - If result may use "current wonky rules": call existing code
        - have ugle cludges in ufunc promotion code (probably)
    - I have no good idea how to do value-based stuff, especially "transition ready" but also get rid of the old code.  The best angle I would have is dynamically creating `AbstractDType` subclasses, but that started to seem too ugly...
    - [My branch](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/compare/main...seberg:implement-value-based-promotion) (intermingled with a lot of nonsense to probe the "future system" and transition).
    - RESULT: We discussed and seemed fine with pushing it forward (and thus potentially have two code paths for now).  It was also discussed if we might get away with "ripping the band-aid off" style transition: The warnings would probably be much more annoying/difficult than the actual change.
