**Present:** Chuck, Sebastian, Ross, Matti


## Triage

* [PRs and issues labelled with "Triage-Review"](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/labels/Triage-review) (please add)

* [PRs and issues labeled with "needs decision"](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/labels/54%20-%20Needs%20decision) (50 open)

* [Open PRs (>250 open)](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pulls) can we get this below 200?

* Ross' list of cross-referenced issues: https://rossbar.github.io/github_graphql/index.html


## Followup

 * Revisit a PR that we've triaged before: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/16221
   - See if there's a straightforward way to handle the compressed formats in the Python std lib



## Topics

* [C++ proposal](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/19713) and [ufunc machinery C++ proposal](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/19753)
  - We really should get some C++ expert to give an opinion on the approach(es)
  - @mreineck might also be someone to ping/ask (pocketfft has the C++ version)

- Some weird PRs (students and people applying for jobs):
  - Apparently Microsoft requires an open source contribution, maybe we could ask them to pay us for that through tidelift ;)

- Readme badge changes look good.  We may want to look into modifying the `setup.py`

- Dropping 32bit wheels for linux, we may want to just do SPEC.
