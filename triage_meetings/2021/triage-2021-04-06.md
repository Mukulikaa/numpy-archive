## Topics

- https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/18718/files
  - We will go with an error instead of userwarning
  - Future plan probably: `dtype=` can also denote the exact output descriptor. Same meaning as `output_dtype=...` so to speak.
  - Make sure to update the NEPs that calling `type_resolution` will not make much sense anymore.

- Matti's work on allocation: A single weird segfault with pickling.

- Data hosting issue (MNIST dataset) discussion.
    - Now hosted by Ross, Scientific ecosystem push might create a solution for in the longer term.

- Shippable will go away, we should just use Travis.  Seems we have that already, so we can just disable it!

- We need more release managers (knowledgeable persons)
