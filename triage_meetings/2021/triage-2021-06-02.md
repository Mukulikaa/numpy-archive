## Topics

- `isclose` discussion seems pregressing well on the issue. 

- String promotion FutureWarning: Should undo it, and hope that `discover_array_parameters` can solve it better next release.

- Array API: is it close enough to merge?
  - explicit import
  - expermental status  (Warning, environment variable, etc... all fine)
  Let's put it in if Aaron thinks its far enough! 

- 1.21 new release candidate this weekend probably (mainly the string promotion future-warning needs to go probably.)
    - Sebastian (forgot): But will still run valgrind tests, etc. before the final release.

- 1.22 release:
  - 64bit BLAS, will be ready go
  - DTypes, should have full experimental exposure in that release  
  - Accept the "like" NEP and document that it is done  (Sebastian: Will do a PR and send a note that it "has been accepted" to the list) – and then backport
  - Value-based promotion: Will try to deprecate it around the time of the 1.21 release (or soon after) – there is no branch for this yet (or there is, but it was an old quick try by @seberg)

- M1 wheels?
