## New topics

- [name=seberg] I talked to the HPy/GraalPython folks yesterday.  They have a fork of NumPy that (somewhat) works with HPy.
  - Very long term goal/aim of getting NumPy HPy compatible
  - One actionable item: The would like to help us port our types to heaptypes!
    - There _might_ be small slowdowns (seems unlikely that this is important to me, but they need to find out)
    - Question: Are there any concerns about starting to do such a port?  Otherwise, I might announce to the mailing list (just in case), but basically hope that they work on it :).
    - Who wants Heaptypes?
      - The PyPy, GraalPython community.
      - The subinterpreter crowd also requires heaptypes.

- Investigate large scale deprecation
  - Find out which functions are actually in use to prioritize
  - Should this be locked into with a major release?
    - Probably not much of a reason, unless maybe it is a long list that is done in one go (maybe with a NEP even).
    - data-api's has a list
    - Stephan Hoyer had done something similar using Google BigQuery before.

- [name=inessa] BUG: fix reciprocal of 0+0j to be inf+nanj: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/17449

- [name=inessa] MAINT: update function's `__module__` attribute in deprecate: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/12804
Rebased version: [MAINT: update function's __module__ attribute in deprecate #22324](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/22324)
*Decision:* merged

-  [name=inessa] ENH: Option to return covariance matrix of fitted coeffecients for polynomial fitters: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/7880
Copy of this PR: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/22271

- [name=brigitta] browsing for abandoned but ready looking `ma` PRs (my plane lands during the meeting, but a yay or nay would be great on these to see whether I should pick them up or not):
    - https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/18637 - looks abandoned, but several others looks interested in the feature, so if it's a thumbs up I'm happy to resurrect it into a new PR.
    - https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/20551 - looks ready to me, including a nice unit test. The PR may need a rebase to ensure the latest CI is run on it before merging, but I don't think anything else is missing. I'm not sure who to ping to review, I'm happy to leave a positive one myself if that's of any help.
