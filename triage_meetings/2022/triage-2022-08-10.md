## Triage

* [PRs and issues labelled with "Triage-Review"](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/labels/Triage-review) (please add)
* [PRs and issues labeled with "needs decision"](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/labels/54%20-%20Needs%20decision)
* [Open PRs - ](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pulls) let's maintain below 200
* [Open PRs from first-time contributors](https://github.com/orgs/numpy/projects/5) 


## Follow up from previous meetings

* @inessapawson MAINT: improve the accuracy of np.sinc for real arguments: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/12924
  * The contributor is willing to continue work, but it will take a few weeks.

* @inessapawson ENH: Add new numpy.ma.* aliases:
https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/21998 and https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/17500
  - The conclusion (Brigitta and Matti) was to close both of these if there is no clear use case that needs the functionalities.
  - The [mailing list discussion](https://mail.python.org/archives/list/numpy-discussion@python.org/thread/P6RLDSCGXXTAUVDHUQAJZFKUOOOQZDE6/) did not disclose a use case for the constructors, but there was a slight preference for consistency

## New topics

- [name=mattip] ENH: [adding a pre-commit hook](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/21449)
Chuck will experiment with it and share feedback at the next triage meeting.
*Discussion:* Do we need it at all?
[name=mattip] I think we should go for this, since the net effect will be to submit a formatted PR. We can then see the format in the PR and either fix the pre-commit hook or decide that the formatting is OK.
[name=brigitta] The PR applies lots of hooks, which is OK, the most controversial one is the reformatting, the rest may be OK being together.
[name=ross] The pre-commit hook should be part of a general overhaul of the code formatting. We should be prepared to reformat the code before actively encouraging the use of a precommit hook.
 
- [name=inessa] ENH: multi-dim weights and axis for np.average: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/10994
  - The general feeling is that we should defer to scipy, and to close the PR and issue.
- [name=inessa] ENH: Adds an out argument to bincount: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/9424
  - Closed as abandoned
  
- [name=rossbar] Disabling `arange` with string dtype: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/22087
  - consensus: go for it!
