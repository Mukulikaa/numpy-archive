**Code of Conduct**
The NumPy Steering Council has made a strong commitment to creating an open, inclusive, and positive community. 
All attendees of NumPy community events must adhere to the NumPy Code of Conduct (https://numpy.org/code-of-conduct/). 
If you see violations, take a screenshot, intervene in a respectful manner, and report it to the CoC Committee via email. For more information, refer to the Reporting Guidelines section on https://numpy.org/code-of-conduct/.

**Present** *(please add your name and GitHub handle, it's completely optional)*: Charles Harris, Tyler Reddy, Sebastian Berg, Inessa Pawson, Daniel Wesloh, Ross Barnowski



## Triage

* [PRs and issues labelled with "Triage-Review"](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/labels/Triage-review) (please add)
* [PRs and issues labeled with "needs decision"](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/labels/54%20-%20Needs%20decision)

* [Open PRs - ](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pulls) let's maintain below 200


## Follow up from previous meetings

* Scripted responses: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/wiki/Scripted-responses
(more examples are added)
  - move the replies to the NumPy documentation:  https://numpy.org/doc/stable/dev/reviewer_guidelines.html?highlight=review#standard-replies-for-reviewing
Most of the wiki will be moved elsewhere since it doesn't have a comprehensive version control system.

* [name=inessa pawson]: ENH: decoupled the codes to use all cache buckets and optimized *zeros* for small chunks of memory: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/8777
Decision: closing

## New topics

* A project/dashboard to keep track of old(er) open PRs: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/projects/16
  - Currently for inactive PRs (PRs older than 1 year).
  - Let's sort out them first, then consider adding new PRs as well.

* [name=seberg] NumPy 1.23 release: `max_row` change to loadtxt? https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/21852
  - Sebastian will send out an email to the list
  - workaround: https://numpy.org/doc/1.23/release/1.23.0-notes.html#np-loadtxt-has-recieved-several-changes

* [name=inessa] ENH: Reverse param in ordering functions: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/14989
Key comments: 
https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/14989#issuecomment-558999381
https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/14989#issuecomment-735515185
Decision: closing

* [name=inessa] ENH: Reverse parameter in np.sort(): https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/14728 
  - `reverse` matches `sorted`, but array-api seems to [use `descending=`](https://data-apis.org/array-api/latest/API_specification/generated/signatures.sorting_functions.sort.html)
  - It should be done "properly" unfortunately.
  - PR can be closed on those grounds, however.
Decision: the steps to move it forward are outlined by @seberg in a comment: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/14728#issuecomment-1170259118

* [name=inessa] ENH: AVX implementation with intrinsic for small_correlate: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/14497
  - Considering its stalled and doesn't fit into the current framework, we will close it.

* ENH: Add new numpy.ma.* aliases:
https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/17480 
Decision: Ross will review it.

* ENH: push histogram calculations to compiled_base: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/9910
Decision: closing

* next NumPy Newcomers’ Hour – Thursday, June 30th, 2022 at 4 pm UTC
Speaker: Ryan C. Cooper
Topic: NumPy in the classroom

* in-person NumPy sprint at SciPy'22: July 16-17th
If you are attending the conference, please join us.
