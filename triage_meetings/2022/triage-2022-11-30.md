## Follow up from previous meetings
 
- [name=inessa] Presentation topics for NumPy Newcomers’ Hour 
To suggest a topic for future presentations, please leave a comment in this tracking issue: https://github.com/numpy/archive/issues/58.

- Inessa: ENH: Add new function `nancov`: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/14784
  - Inessa will ping the mailing list
  - [original issue](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/14414) asks for NaN handling for convolution and xcorrelation. astropy has these but that is an argument to push it into NumPy (if SciPy doesn't have it and doesn't have an obvious place.)

- Last day of Closember - Well done, team!



## New topics

- Inessa: sprint at PyData Global (virtual) 
When: Saturday, December 3rd, 2:00 - 8:00 pm UTC. 
If you are available as a mentor, please sign up here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LiiAMFvZZQpZWW2D2r_isnpqRUwK325xcXDZEpCLj5c/edit?usp=sharing
You may choose to help for 2 hours only or stay longer.

- Inessa: Monitoring second-time contributions: https://github.com/orgs/numpy/projects/5 (see the last column, scroll all the way to the left)
Automation solutions: 
– a bot (e.g., Matplotlib)
– via devstats dashboard
Devstats is preferred.
Inessa will ping Ross and Jarrod to update the dashboard and add the 2nd contribution metric.

- Inessa: ENH: Implement `__round__` specialmethod for ndarrays?: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/6248
  - Generally in favor. It should do what `np.around` does: in fact, it should just call `around`.
  - Sebastian will ping the mailing list.

- Triage review list: ENH: Add keyword option to histogram in order to return bin centers: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/13194
Decision: closing.
A PR to document the work-around is welcome.

- Inessa: BUG: Fix <complex 0>^{non-zero}: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/18535
Decision: merging.
Zeroes could be defined better. This can be done in a follow up PR if there is demand for it.
