## Triage

* [PRs and issues labelled with "Triage-Review"](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/labels/Triage-review) (please add)
* [PRs and issues labeled with "needs decision"](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/labels/54%20-%20Needs%20decision) (50 open)

* [Open PRs (>250 open)](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pulls) can we get this below 200?


## Topics

* Add intro to your profile on Slack.
This is optional, but would be helpful for newcomers and less active community members.

* One more difficult question: `arr1d[0] = value` force-cast coerces scalars.
  * Problem: I want a "safer" way of converting integers for NEP 50 (value based promotion).  Because it seems desireable that e.g. `uint8_arr + 1000` raises, but `np.uint8(1000)` currently does not (maybe more relevant for `-1`).
  * Typical casting has the "cast safety" logic, but passes it out (I prefer it, it feels clean and should make changing cast levels more easily).
  * Typical item setting, has one `setitem` function.  Should we have two?  Should we introduce a safe/unsafe flag that is passed in?  Should it use a try/except "style" logic, maybe even considering `integer_arr1d[0] = 3.0` as OK, because it doesn't lose precision?
  * May need to check how noisy actual "future warnings" would be that are turned on for a full release.

* MAINT, DOC: get rid of unicode, unicode_, string_: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/20064
@inessapawson A review is needed.

* BUG: Input matrix with axis None was flattened before using median: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/10656
@inessapawson Should we finish it or close it? (The original contributor hasn't responded since Feb 17, 2019.)
Decesion: close it.
In general, use of np.matrix  is no longer encouraged. The reported bug, perhaps, should be fixed, but the proposed solution isnâ€™t optimal.


* Expose datetime functionality, and if, how? https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/21199
  * Should we expose it?
  * Some of these functions call into Python (e.g. errors), do they need to be exposed as C-API throught the API table, rather than linked like `npy_math`?

* Thoughts on reductions and reorderable flag: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/20970
