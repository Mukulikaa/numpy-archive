## Triage

* [PRs and issues labelled with "Triage-Review"](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/labels/Triage-review) (please add)
* [PRs and issues labeled with "needs decision"](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/labels/54%20-%20Needs%20decision)
* [Open PRs - ](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pulls) let's maintain below 200
* [Open PRs from first-time contributors](https://github.com/orgs/numpy/projects/5) 


## Follow up from previous meetings


* @inessapawson ENH: Add new numpy.ma.* aliases:
https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/21998 and https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/17500
  - The conclusion (Brigitta and Matti) was to close both of these if there is no clear use case that needs the functionalities.
  - The [mailing list discussion](https://mail.python.org/archives/list/numpy-discussion@python.org/thread/P6RLDSCGXXTAUVDHUQAJZFKUOOOQZDE6/) did not disclose a use case for the constructors, but there was a slight preference for consistency
  - *Decision on 2022-08-24:* Closing
- [name=mattip] ENH: [adding a pre-commit hook](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/21449)
Chuck will experiment with it and share feedback at the next triage meeting.
*Discussion:* Do we need it at all?
[name=mattip] I think we should go for this, since the net effect will be to submit a formatted PR. We can then see the format in the PR and either fix the pre-commit hook or decide that the formatting is OK.
[name=brigitta] The PR applies lots of hooks, which is OK, the most controversial one is the reformatting, the rest may be OK being together.
[name=ross] The pre-commit hook should be part of a general overhaul of the code formatting. We should be prepared to reformat the code before actively encouraging the use of a precommit hook.

- *Discussion/Conclusion from 2022-08-24:* 
  - we should switch to black.
Lucasz Langa is open to the feedback from the SciPy community to improve the math-related formatting.
  - We should decide as a community to modify the entire codebase at once. There is no strong desire to add friction to contributors before we do that. We would like a modified black for python formatting, pyupgrade for syntax modernization, and are pretty happy clang-format for C/C++. 
  - Link to discussion about math formatting for `black`: https://discuss.scientific-python.org/t/how-to-format-mathematical-expressions/62
  - Discussion regarding the PR on the mailing list: https://mail.python.org/archives/list/numpy-discussion@python.org/message/WZTS3XZKKM3MKRPZ5XD6SHSREYLTQ3DC/
Ross and Chuck will share their thoughts and outcomes of today's discussion in a thread.
 
- [name=inessa] ENH: multi-dim weights and axis for np.average: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/10994
  - The general feeling is that we should defer to scipy, and to close the PR and issue.

## New topics
- [name=inessa] ENH: `ndarray.__format__` implementation for numeric dtypes:
https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/19550
Besides the minor fixes suggested by Matti, the PR is ready to be merged. A release note is needed. If Ivan is unavailable, Inessa will submit it.

- [name=inessa] ENH: add functionality NpyAppendArray to numpy.format: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/20321/
Matti will share his thoughts on the mailing list in a thread. See here: https://mail.python.org/archives/list/numpy-discussion@python.org/message/GMPIF5PJ63GLJO4FN3NETYWOXMHZHVQJ/
