# 2022-03-09 NumPy Development Meeting -- Triage

Note: we alternate between [community meetings](https://hackmd.io/76o-IxCjQX2mOXO_wwkcpg) and triage meetings.
- Time: 17:00 UTC
- Join via Zoom at https://berkeley.zoom.us/j/762261535 (or [dial-in](https://berkeley.zoom.us/u/aC3ENhycM))
- [Numpy community events calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/r?cid=YmVya2VsZXkuZWR1X2lla2dwaWdtMjMyamJobGRzZmIyYzJqODFjQGdyb3VwLmNhbGVuZGFyLmdvb2dsZS5jb20)
- [Previous community meetings](https://github.com/numpy/archive/tree/master/status_meetings)
- [Previous triage meetings](https://github.com/numpy/archive/tree/master/triage_meetings)


**Present:** Tyler, Sebastian, Rohit, Ross, Chuck, Bhavuk, Sayed


## Triage

* [PRs and issues labelled with "Triage-Review"](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/labels/Triage-review) (please add)
* [PRs and issues labeled with "needs decision"](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/labels/54%20-%20Needs%20decision) (50 open)

* [Open PRs (>250 open)](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pulls) can we get this below 200?


## Followup




## Topics

* Possibly change the meeting time? Matti has a conflict with the conda-forge team meeting which is always at this time, and it is confusing that we alternate times with the community meeing on off weeks. Or is there someone else with a fixed conflict (Ralf?)
  * Lets do another whenisgood, since daylight saving is also coming up.

* Triage review tagged (e.g. casting of float to int16 with undefined behaviour?)
  - Unsafe cast from float to int16 e.g., allow udnefined behaviour?
  - We already have undefined behaviour for `.astype(np.int64)` – returns minimum on my computer
  - There seems to be a slight preference to allow the change in (with release notes)
  - A warning is given (overflow or invalid), this is a bug and we just should make sure tha thappens before the next release.

* Look at issues for 1.22.4

* Thoughts on reductions and reorderable flag: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/20970

* One more difficult question: `arr1d[0] = value` force-cast coerces scalars.
  * Problem: I want a "safer" way of converting integers for NEP 50 (value based promotion).  Because it seems desireable that e.g. `uint8_arr + 1000` raises, but `np.uint8(1000)` currently does not (maybe more relevant for `-1`).
  * Typical casting has the "cast safety" logic, but passes it out (I prefer it, it feels clean and should make changing cast levels more easily).
  * Typical item setting, has one `setitem` function.  Should we have two?  Should we introduce a safe/unsafe flag that is passed in?  Should it use a try/except "style" logic, maybe even considering `integer_arr1d[0] = 3.0` as OK, because it doesn't lose precision?

* Discuss transitions to "weak" Python scalars.

* NumPy Newcomers' Hour – March 10th, 2022 at 4 pm UTC
*Speaker:* Mukulika Pahari
*Topic:*  Presentation of the tutorial <i>Analyzing the impact of the lockdown on air quality in Delhi, India</i> (https://numpy.org/numpy-tutorials/content/tutorial-air-quality-analysis.html)
