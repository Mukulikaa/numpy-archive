- Time: 17:00 UTC
- Join via Zoom at https://berkeley.zoom.us/j/762261535 (or [dial-in](https://berkeley.zoom.us/u/aC3ENhycM))
- [Numpy community events calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/r?cid=YmVya2VsZXkuZWR1X2lla2dwaWdtMjMyamJobGRzZmIyYzJqODFjQGdyb3VwLmNhbGVuZGFyLmdvb2dsZS5jb20)

- [Previous triage meetings](https://github.com/numpy/archive/tree/master/triage_meetings)


**Present:** Alex, Ross, Chuck, Inessa, Sebastian, Bas van Beek, Rohit


## Triage

* [PRs and issues labelled with "Triage-Review"](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/labels/Triage-review) (please add)
* [PRs and issues labeled with "needs decision"](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/labels/54%20-%20Needs%20decision) (50 open)

* [Open PRs (>250 open)](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pulls) can we get this below 200?


## Followup

* `PyArray_Pack` and use for `arr.fill()`? https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/20924
  * One thing that differs (main thing) is that `obj_arr.fill(zero_d_obj_arr)` currently unpacks the 0-D array.
  * Can we "standardize" what "scalar filling" means?


## Topics

* Module deprecation implementations: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/20481
  + Concretely, for the F2PY refactor we would like to keep backwards compatibility
  + The main question is to discuss the complexity of the proposed implementation

*  ENH: support "python setup.py build_sphinx" and creation of man files:https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/20229 â€“ CLOSED

* BUG: Find dtype in genfromtxt for single column of data: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/16908

* ENH: Update piecewise to handle multivariate functions: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/18979

* What does the `benchmark` CI job do?
  * Nobody quite knows :)

* Should/can we improve how structured arrays work together with Python mappings?

* Thoughts on reductions and reorderable flag: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/20970

* Lets briefly talk about transitions to "weak" Python scalars (if there is time).
