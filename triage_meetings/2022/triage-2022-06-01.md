## Triage

* [PRs and issues labelled with "Triage-Review"](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/labels/Triage-review) (please add)
* [PRs and issues labeled with "needs decision"](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/labels/54%20-%20Needs%20decision) (50 open)

* [Open PRs (>230 open)](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pulls) can we get this below 200?


## Follow up from previous meetings



## New topics

* [name=Melissa] [GitHub Projects](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/trying-out-the-new-projects-experience/about-projects) as a solution for keeping track of closed PRs with good ideas.
GP boards would be used in addition to applying "good idea" labels.
*Discussion:* A project board is likely to get out of sync when we are not working on the issue/topic actively.
Let's keep it in mind when we do as it's a good tool to organize work, especially if working collaboratively. 

 * [name=inessa pawson] Strategy to reduce the number of open PRs
*Discussion:* Why should we care about the number of open PRs?
It's one of the indicators of project health. A large number of open PRs is a discouraging sign for new contributors.
*Action item:* Schedule a sprint to tag+close the old PRs. Maybe, during SciPy'22.

* [name=inessa pawson] Maintainers' Sprint at SciPy'22 (in hybrid format).
Please respond with your availability to Inessa's email. 
Sebastian: Tuesday, Saturday, or Sunday would probably make most sense. 

* [name=Ganesh] ENH: `float.hex` and `float.fromhex` Implementation
  Wanted thoughts on any changes required for this PR: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/20083

* [name=seberg] When are micro-optimizations worthwhile?  [Is this one?](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/21531)  (Seems to give about 6% for very small arrays in ufuncs.)

* [name=Inessa Pawson] MAINT: Optimize np.isin and np.in1d for integer arrays: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/12065

* [name=Inessa Pawson] BUG:numpy.ma: Fix ma.in1d: _slow_integer: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/20011

* [name=rossbar] Polynomial symbol now has two approvals - other feedback welcome! https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/16154

* [name=mattip] Restoring multiple NaNs in `np.unique` https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/21623 - kwarg name `equal_nans`?

* next NumPy Newcomers’ Hour – June 2nd, 2022 at 4 pm UTC
