## Triage

* [PRs and issues labelled with "Triage-Review"](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/labels/Triage-review) (please add)
* [PRs and issues labeled with "needs decision"](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/labels/54%20-%20Needs%20decision) (51 open)

* [Open PRs (>250 open)](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pulls) can we get this below 200?


* Thoughts on reductions and reorderable flag: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/20970

## Topics

* There are quite a few stalled/inactive open PRs. Many of them could be closed. Some of them have good ideas that could be implemented in the future (under the right circumstances). How should we label them?
Options:
  - deferred
  - good idea.  

Decision: We have already introduced the label "good idea". Let's keep it, it gets the message across.

* [name=Inessa Pawson] Idea: "mentor available" 
Tag issues that NumPy maintainers would be willing to work on with a mentee/s.
Discussion:
   * Letâ€™s do it as live coding sessions at some of the NumPy Newcomers Hours. 
Benefits: larger audience, fits the format of this recurring community event.
   * We'll plan the first session for the next Newcomers Hour (May 5th).
   * "Code reading" is also interesting and important for onboarding.
   * A [book](https://www.manning.com/books/the-programmers-brain) recommendation from Alex on the same topic.

* [This PR](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/18535) about `<complex 0>^{non-zero}` is lingering. Can we finish it?
Action item: Sebastian will follow up.

* [name=Inessa Pawson] CI: Cygwin failure tracking issue: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/20221 
Cygwin seems to be running ok. Should we close this issue?
Decision: closing

* [name=Inessa Pawson] CI, TST: Run Cygwin CI with Netlib reference BLAS and re-enable linalg tests: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/20669
Decision: pinging the contributor if it's still relevant. We can merge it as it is. 
Update: It has been merged.

* [name=Inessa Pawson] Mentored Sprints at PyCon US 2022 are held on Saturday, April 30th at 20:00-24:00 (8:00 PM to 12:00 AM) UTC.
It's a joint sprint with SciPy.
