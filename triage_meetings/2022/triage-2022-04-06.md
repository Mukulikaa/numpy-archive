## Triage

* [PRs and issues labelled with "Triage-Review"](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/labels/Triage-review) (please add)
* [PRs and issues labeled with "needs decision"](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/labels/54%20-%20Needs%20decision) (51 open)

* [Open PRs (>250 open)](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pulls) can we get this below 200?


* Thoughts on reductions and reorderable flag: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/20970

## Topics

* There are a lot of stalled open PRs, we should close many of them.  But it would be good to label them so they can be found/picked up again (e.g. with a "defferred" label).


* Remove setup.py files from installed files: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/1733 
[name=Inessa Pawson] Is it still a relevant issue?

* BUG: Fix norm type promotion: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/17709
[name=Inessa Pawson] Do we need a release note here?  https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/17709#pullrequestreview-525030383

* [name=Chuck] This PR: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/13261

* Discuss transitions to "weak" Python scalars.
 
* [This PR](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/18535) about `<complex 0>^{non-zero}` is lingering. Can we finish it?


* [name=sebastian] Float to integer casts seem pretty badly defined in C (for out of range values).  My CPU gives often (but not always) "invalid" FPEs:
  * `np.uint8(1000000.)` may give a warning if the value is very large.  I supsect (on most CPUs?) we are guaranteed warnings when running into truly undefined behaviour, but no warning may occur when normal "integer overflow/rollover" happens.  I.e. the result is the same as `np.int32(value).astype(np.int8)` and that cast is "well defined".
  * I would argue this is OK, but it is "undefined behaviour" we are leaking from C...

* [name=Sebastian] Related to previous:  If casting causes Floating point warnings in ufuncs, the same warning may also happen at a later step (or even during multiple casts) for some ufunc paths.  Most users shouldn't notice, since it is exactly the same warning so Python will hide it.  But I don't think there is an obvious way to avoid it.  (Well, at least)
  * Basically, just to confirm that we shouldn't worry about it too much for now. 

* [name=Rohit] [This issue](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/21304) about adding `cmocka`

  - Should integrate with `runtests.py` (this means some nice statistics and also a flag)
  - **Conditionally alright**, especially if optional
  - Watch build times and also make sure the right flags are passed in the build system
  - Stick to only F2PY for now, perhaps more later
  - What about C++?
       - We use `extern C` in any case, so a large subset can be tested
       - Also C++ testing libraries release rapidly and depend on newer compiler versions (e.g. Catch2, GTests, etc)
  - Some precedent:
    - `doxygen` was added as an optional docs-only dependency
