## Follow up from previous meetings

- [name=mattip] ENH: [adding a pre-commit hook](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/21449)
Chuck will experiment with it and share feedback at the next triage meeting.
*Discussion:* Do we need it at all?
[name=mattip] I think we should go for this, since the net effect will be to submit a formatted PR. We can then see the format in the PR and either fix the pre-commit hook or decide that the formatting is OK.
[name=brigitta] The PR applies lots of hooks, which is OK, the most controversial one is the reformatting, the rest may be OK being together.
[name=ross] The pre-commit hook should be part of a general overhaul of the code formatting. We should be prepared to reformat the code before actively encouraging the use of a precommit hook.

- *Discussion from 2022-08-24:* 
  - we should switch to black.
Lucasz Langa is open to the feedback from the SciPy community to improve the math-related formatting.
  - We should decide as a community to modify the entire codebase at once. There is no strong desire to add friction to contributors before we do that. We would like a modified black for python formatting, pyupgrade for syntax modernization, and are pretty happy clang-format for C/C++. 
  - Link to discussion about math formatting for `black`: https://discuss.scientific-python.org/t/how-to-format-mathematical-expressions/62
  - Discussion regarding the PR on the mailing list: https://mail.python.org/archives/list/numpy-discussion@python.org/message/WZTS3XZKKM3MKRPZ5XD6SHSREYLTQ3DC/
Ross and Chuck will share their thoughts and outcomes of today's discussion in a thread.
 

- [name=inessa] ENH: `ndarray.__format__` implementation for numeric dtypes:
https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/19550
Besides the minor fixes suggested by Matti, the PR is ready to be merged. Release note is submitted: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/19550/commits/6b4bd655b28115aaedd69efc7c9e76a3a3180b47

- [name=inessa] ENH: add functionality NpyAppendArray to numpy.format: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/20321/
Matti has shared his thoughts on the mailing list in a thread. See here: https://mail.python.org/archives/list/numpy-discussion@python.org/message/GMPIF5PJ63GLJO4FN3NETYWOXMHZHVQJ/

## New topics

- [name=seberg] DLPack meeting: send whenisgood?  I would like to know the C++ side is settled (i.e. new names?), and only then nail down the specifics...

- [name=inessa] next NumPy Newcomers Hour 
When: September 8th at 4pm UTC
Guest speaker: Sebastian Berg
Topic: Ufuncs and dtypes: new possibilities in NumPy
For more info visit: https://mail.python.org/archives/list/numpy-discussion@python.org/message/PMDLMBYML66J6M2XJVIER53UWWEIJMPU/


- [name=inessa] NumPy was selected as a featured project for [Grace Hopper Celebration Open Source Day 2022](
https://ghc.anitab.org/programs-and-awards/open-source-day/) held on Friday, September 16th, 8:00 am - 3:00 pm Pacific Time. 
We are currentlylooking for mentors who would be helping NumPy newcomers during this event. If you are available, please sign up here:
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Y1t7-Yu2INR-Unl277TCJmlKOSNWok8fX2NbES5jcgk/edit?usp=sharing.
You may choose to help for 2 hours only or stay longer.

  ***Who can be a NumPy mentor at a mentored/newcomers sprint?***
If you are comfortable providing guidance on git, NumPy development workflow, building NumPy documentation, setting up and using development environment, and using Gitpod, you are a great candidate for being a NumPy mentor to newcomers.

- [name=inessa] Presentation topics for NumPy Newcomers’ Hour 
To suggest a topic for future presentations, please leave a comment in this tracking issue: https://github.com/numpy/archive/issues/58.

-  [name=inessa] BUG: Distinguish exact vs. equivalent dtype for C type aliases: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/21995
- [name=inessa] BUG: Make mask_invalid consistent with mask_where if copy is set to False: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/22046
