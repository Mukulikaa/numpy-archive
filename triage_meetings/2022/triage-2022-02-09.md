**Present:** Chuck, Sebastian, Inessa, Rohit, Matti, Tyler, Ross, Dilip Venkatesh


## Triage

* [PRs and issues labelled with "Triage-Review"](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/labels/Triage-review) (please add)
* [PRs and issues labeled with "needs decision"](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/labels/54%20-%20Needs%20decision) (50 open)

* [Open PRs (>250 open)](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pulls) can we get this below 200?


## Followup

* [Move loadtxt to C](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/20580) - any followups?

* Dealing with CVEs: Got emails that they will be updated by now (in some form) but I didn't check :)

* Sebastian made a new prototype: https://github.com/seberg/unitdtype/tree/main/unitdtype


## Topics

*  Merge generalized linear algebra routines into numpy.linalg #3217: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/3217 – CLOSED

* BUG: Vague error message from ufunc np.any: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/20898

* PR from the first time contributor
DEP: Deprecate use of axis=MAXDIMS instead of axis=None #20920 https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/20920

* `PyArray_Pack` and use for `arr.fill()`? https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/20924
  * One thing that differs (main thing) is that `obj_arr.fille(zero_d_obj_arr)` currently unpacks the 0-D array.
  * Can we "standardize" what "scalar filling" means?

* Thoughts on reductions and reorderable flag: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/20970

* NumPy Newcomers’ Hour – Feb 10th, 2022 at 4 pm UTC
Panel discussion: Finding your way in the NumPy codebase
Panelists: Matti Picus, Sebastian Berg, Tyler Reddy
Submit your questions to Inessa via email or Slack


### Coverage and Tests
https://gcc-python-plugin.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cpychecker.html --> can help with CPython debugging? **not really** --> Might still be of use for refcount stuff
^ Look into later

https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/6.3.1/contexts.html#dynamic-contexts --> See which functions cover which parts of the code
