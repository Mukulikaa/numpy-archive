## Triage

* [PRs and issues labelled with "Triage-Review"](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/labels/triage%20review) (please add)
* [Open PRs - ](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pulls) let's maintain below 200
* [Open PRs from first-time contributors](https://github.com/orgs/numpy/projects/5) 
* [Inactive PRs](https://github.com/orgs/numpy/projects/6)


## Follow up from previous meetings
 
- [name=inessa] Presentation topics for NumPy Newcomersâ€™ Hour 
To suggest a topic for future presentations, please leave a comment in this tracking issue: https://github.com/numpy/archive/issues/58.

-  [name=eendebakpt] MAINT: Make output of Polynomial representations consistent https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/21760
   - Change is an improvement and we should go ahead with it
   - Ross will take a look (and tagged as needs release note)

- PRs/Issues we should mark for 1.24?
  - Changing the formatting for scalars (NEP 51)?
    - Should aim for 1.24 (in whatever form, optional or not)
    - Test SciPy against this (Tyler will do this).

 - NEP 50: Will try to look into fixing up can-cast as well.
    - `np.can_cast(1000, np.uint8, casting="safe")`
    - Sebastian will try to write this up, since it is tricky even after a longer discussion.


## New topics

- Sebastian: Discussion about longdouble
  - It is has a confusing name. The printing would change and improve, but not the actual names.
  - One approach: deprecate/remove, but provide external numpy-longdouble as replacement.

- Matti: Include OpenBLAS into the next release.
*Decision:* Let's do it!
  

- Inessa: PyData NYC (https://pydata.org/nyc2022/) is running a special event called CodeDuels (similar to LeetCode Contests). The platform for running this competition was built by two NumFOCUS Diversity Scholars. They would appreciate help generating more questions of all difficulty levels. Submit your suggestions using this form: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScXE4D8zcIbUEEL9CW_aXsUW_8CB7NAP9sz8aNDGG2PiGs9lQ/viewform

- Inessa: PyData NYC (https://pydata.org/nyc2022/) development sprint is on Nov 8th. 
Ganesh Kathiresan (NumPy) and Juan Luis Cano Rodrigues (PolyAstro) will be hosting the NumPy sprint in person. Expect PRs on Nov 8-9th.

- Inessa: Growing the NumPy triage team with https://www.codetriage.com/ 
Github users individually sign up to receive a selected number of issues per day.
Case study: Pandas (https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas#contributing-to-pandas).
*Discussion:* 
  * Let's clarify the triage guidelines first. 
  * Draft of the SciPy triage guide: https://hackmd.io/8H0P9QKRScWxbOBoMRNTCw
  * Feedback from pandas would be useful.
  * To keep in mind: triaging NumPy issues requires a significant knowledge of the code base (might not be the best starting point for newcomers)


- Melissa: How-to arange, linspace: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/22375
Ross needs to give a final review.

- More discussion needed for [`ufunc.resolved_dtypes`]( https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/22422)?

- Inessa: ENH: Add new function nancov: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/14784
Needs a review.

- Inessa: Listing of all numpy functions that support `__array_function__`: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/15544
What is the best way to implement it?
Inessa will respond in the issue.

- Inessa: BUG: Fix <complex 0>^{non-zero}: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/18535
Needs a review.

- Inessa: MAINT: Speed up numpy.nonzero: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/18368
Should we close it?
