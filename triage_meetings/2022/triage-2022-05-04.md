## Triage

* [PRs and issues labelled with "Triage-Review"](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/labels/Triage-review) (please add)
* [PRs and issues labeled with "needs decision"](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/labels/54%20-%20Needs%20decision) (51 open)

* [Open PRs (>230 open)](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pulls) can we get this below 200?



## Topics

* The next 1.22.4 release is waiting on multibuild and Cython fix would also be nice.

* [name=seberg] Push through PRs?:
  * [Scalar math](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/21188)
  * [String ufuncs (comparisons)](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/21041)

* [name=seberg] The FPE in cast PR would be awesome to discuss a bit as well (or move forwar), since it would be a basis for getting rid of value based casting also:
  * https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/21437

* Does anyone have an opinion on trying to silence Python caused FPEs in ufuncs (and in theory casting): https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/21416
  * Downside: restoring FPEs takes some time and is slow if there are FPEs set.
  * Upside: It is strictly speaking more correct, we should not raise warnings for things that Python itself ignores them, like `np.inf - np.inf`.

* Go through isses/PR milestoned for 1.22.x
