## Follow up from previous meetings
 
- [name=inessa] Presentation topics for NumPy Newcomersâ€™ Hour 
To suggest a topic for future presentations, please leave a comment in this tracking issue: https://github.com/numpy/archive/issues/58.

- Inessa: ENH: Add new function `nancov`: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/14784
  - Inessa will ping the mailing list: https://mail.python.org/archives/list/numpy-discussion@python.org/message/COGXEXA4ZCLDI7LHLUZ3HV4TUJPHVQNV/
  - [original issue](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/14414) asks for NaN handling for convolution and xcorrelation. astropy has these but that is an argument to push it into NumPy (if SciPy doesn't have it and doesn't have an obvious place.)


## New topics

- Inessa: MAINT: Speed up numpy.nonzero: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/18368
Decision: closing

- Triage review list: ENH: loadtxt with non-matching number of fields in dtype:
https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/6388
Decision: Sebastian will finalize it.

- Triage review list: BUG: (closes #4352) any and all applied to object arrays should return bool: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/11857
  - Sebastian will ping the mailing list that we will probably give this a shot soon (or very similiar to the PR, Sebastian is unclear why the `None` path exists)

- Chuck: Move triage meeting one hour later (5 pm UTC)    - Sebastian will inquire on Slack
