## Follow up from previous meetings
 
- [name=inessa] Presentation topics for NumPy Newcomersâ€™ Hour 
To suggest a topic for future presentations, please leave a comment in this tracking issue: https://github.com/numpy/archive/issues/58.


## New topics

- [name=inessa] ENH: Added Fourier transform option for numpy.polynomial.polymul: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/22255
  - Question for Mateo (the author): What's his use case?
  - PR is closed now, with a clear use-case maybe we could discuss again.

-  [name=inessa] DOC: Update the docstring for np.around: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/21853
   - Ross will take a look, possibly tweak, and then merge the PR.

-  [name=eendebakpt] MAINT: Make output of Polynomial representations consistent https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/21760
   - Change is an improvement and we should go ahead with it
   - Ross will take a look (and tagged as needs release note)

- PRs/Issues we should mark for 1.24?
  - Changing the formatting for scalars (NEP 51)?
    - Should aim for 1.24 (in whatever form, optional or not)
    - Test SciPy against this (Tyler will do this).

  - NEP 50: Will try to look into fixing up can-cast as well.
    - `np.can_cast(1000, np.uint8, casting="safe")`
    - Sebastian will try to write this up, since it is tricky even after a longer discussion.
