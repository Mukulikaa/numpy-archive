# 2022-01-26 NumPy Development Meeting -- Triage

Note: we alternate between [community meetings](https://hackmd.io/76o-IxCjQX2mOXO_wwkcpg) and triage meetings.

- Time: 17:00 UTC
- Join via Zoom at https://berkeley.zoom.us/j/762261535 (or [dial-in](https://berkeley.zoom.us/u/aC3ENhycM))
- [Previous community meetings](https://github.com/numpy/archive/tree/master/status_meetings)
- [Previous triage meetings](https://github.com/numpy/archive/tree/master/triage_meetings)


**Present:** Tyler, Abel, Alex, Rohit, Chuck, Sebastian, Riley Murray, David Huard, Inessa, Ross, Matti


## Triage

* [PRs and issues labelled with "Triage-Review"](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/labels/Triage-review) (please add)
* [PRs and issues labeled with "needs decision"](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/labels/54%20-%20Needs%20decision) (50 open)

* [Open PRs (>250 open)](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pulls) can we get this below 200?


## Followup


* BUG: fix string truncation bug in loadtxt #19042: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/19042

* [Move loadtxt to C](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/20580) - is this complete enough?
  * Basically finished (and arguably good to go).  There are some tiny tweaks still possible, but mainly Sebastian wanted to have a brief look with Ross before giving the "go ahead".

* Dealing with CVEs
  - (Sebastian) Send the CVEs, have to follow up once more (they want me to confirm my github account and provide proof(?), but as I understand that is not necessary to mark it as "Disputed" at least.).


## Topics

* Weighted quantile option in nanpercentile:
https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/8935
https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/9211
  * `xarray` also has a [PR on this](https://github.com/pydata/xarray/pull/6059)
  * OK with full sort (maybe mention it in the parameter description that weights are currently slower?)
  * `aweights` vs. `fweights`.  Probably should figure out both, or only implement `fweights` (Sebastian: I do think `aweights` is basically equivalent to `fweights=aweights / aweights.sum() * len(aweights)`?)
    * Ideally both, `aweights` seems more important. 
    * Does R, etc. have weights and what type?
  * Defer to SciPy?
  * We want this :).


* Uploading cibuildwheel wheels to anaconda instead of numpy-wheels ones from multibuild
  * PR [20890](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/20890) is ready for review
  * We still need a solution for aarch64. Should we redo the numpy/numpy travis script to only use cibuildwheel or leave the scripts as-is and add cibuildwheel?

* Overly restrictive error message in vstack #6610: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/6610

* Discussion with Riley about randomized linear algebra.
  * Python library/prototype: https://github.com/BallisticLA/parla
  * SciPy meetings: https://hackmd.io/pyhudrC5TgSwdJtpPldHgQ

* **Data Umbrella LatAm/Africa sprint 2022**
*Important dates*
Saturday, June 18, 2022:  Pre-sprint session (1 hour) 
Saturday, June 25, 2022:  Day of Sprint (4 hours)
Saturday, July 9, 2022:  Post-sprint follow-up (1 hour)

* Sebastian: I made a new prototype: https://github.com/seberg/unitdtype/tree/main/unitdtype
