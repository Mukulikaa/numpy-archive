## Triage

* [PRs and issues labelled with "Triage-Review"](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/labels/Triage-review) (please add)
* [PRs and issues labeled with "needs decision"](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/labels/54%20-%20Needs%20decision) (50 open)

* [Open PRs (>250 open)](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pulls) can we get this below 200?


## Followup

* NEP: Making details of np.core private: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/11924
    * Should we deal with `np.compat` as well?

* F2PY refactor https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/20481

## Topics

* Meeting times?  Move the other meeting by 30 minutes, keep this time?
  - Keep this time, make other meeting 1h earlier. 

* Reducing the number of open issues and PRs
  - Better docs on filing issues: https://github.com/numpy/numpy.org/issues/72
  - Case study: https://github.com/OctoPrint/OctoPrint/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md
  - References: https://blog.jessfraz.com/post/the-art-of-closing/

* Remaining issues for 1.22.1:
  * Put in remaining array-api PRs, otherwise, get out the new release and push of all other tagged issue.

* BUG: fix string truncation bug in loadtxt #19042: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/19042

* [Array interface from PyCapsule](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/20674) Proposal to hold on to the PyCapsule as a.base instead of the contents of the capsule
  * Let's put the PR in

* [Move loadtxt to C](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/20580) - is this complete enough?
  * This seems to be the best choice The current python code is not really maintainable and using csv will be too slow.
  * (Sebastian) only alternative I see is `import csv; np.fromiter(csv.reader(...))` (I would expect this would be at least 2x slower)
  * Conclusion: let's move forward with this PR
  * Look into making sure that no silent changes due to semantic change in `max_rows` is possible

* Dealing with CVEs
  - Sebastian: Will talk to Ralf.
* Next Newcomerâ€™s Hour is on Jan 13th at 4 pm UTC. Ganesh Kathiresan will cover how to:
  - Browse code with vim+ctags+cscope
  - How to debug core files (basics)
