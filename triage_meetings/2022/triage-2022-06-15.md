* [Open PRs - 198](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pulls) Let's maintain below 200


## Follow up from previous meetings
 * [name=inessa pawson] Strategy to reduce the number of open PRs
 
*Discussion:* Why should we care about the number of open PRs?

It's one of the indicators of project health. A large number of open PRs is a discouraging sign for new contributors.

*Action item:* Schedule a sprint to tag+close the old PRs. 
Shall we do it at the next triage meeting (June 29th)?

  Wanted thoughts on any changes required for this PR: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/20083

* [name=Inessa Pawson] MAINT: Optimize np.isin and np.in1d for integer arrays: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/12065
  * NEW: Should we consider that `method` (or similar kwarg) or not?

* [name=Inessa Pawson] BUG:numpy.ma: Fix ma.in1d: _slow_integer: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/20011
