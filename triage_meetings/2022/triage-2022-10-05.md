## Follow up from previous meetings
 
- Inessa: Presentation topics for NumPy Newcomersâ€™ Hour 
To suggest a topic for future presentations, please leave a comment in this tracking issue: https://github.com/numpy/archive/issues/58.

- Inessa: ENH: `ndarray.__format__` implementation for numeric dtypes:
https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/19550
Decision: If the author doesn't respond within the next 2 weeks, let's finish it up (add the error) to include in the next release.

- Inessa: ENH: add functionality NpyAppendArray to numpy.format: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/20321/
Should we rename it as suggested? https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/20321/#issuecomment-1262930325
Decision: merging

- Inessa: BUG: Make mask_invalid consistent with mask_where if copy is set to False: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/22046
  [x] Ping Marten (@mhvk), but otherwise just go ahead and try.

- Inessa: ENH: Option to return covariance matrix of fitted coefficients for polynomial fitters: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/7880
   - Commented, probably a new method and needs some care.  But generally a good addition.


## New topics

- Brigitta: browsing for abandoned but ready looking `ma` PRs:
    - https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/18637 - looks abandoned, but several others looks interested in the feature, so if it's a thumbs up I'm happy to resurrect it into a new PR.
    - https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/20551 - looks ready to me, including a nice unit test. The PR may need a rebase to ensure the latest CI is run on it before merging, but I don't think anything else is missing. I'm not sure who to ping to review, I'm happy to leave a positive one myself if that's of any help.
      - A bit more complicated with a new similar issue also being opened recently.  Sebastian will ping Brigitta and Marten there and link this one.
      
- rossbar: How to deprecate C-API: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/22313

- Ganesh: [Feature request: Add to numpy simple functions for transform coordinate systems #5228](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/5228)
Is this feature request worth pursuing? Sample PR for [`cart2pol`](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/22377) added for reference on change involved. [Do we keep it separate from NumPy namespace](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/5228#issuecomment-186568631)

- Inessa: DOC: "Scalar arrays" (or 0-dimensional arrays): https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/22289
Decision: closing
