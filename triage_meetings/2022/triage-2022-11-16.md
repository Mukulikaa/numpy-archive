## Follow up from previous meetings
 
- [name=inessa] Presentation topics for NumPy Newcomers’ Hour 
To suggest a topic for future presentations, please leave a comment in this tracking issue: https://github.com/numpy/archive/issues/58.

 
- Inessa: PyData NYC (https://pydata.org/nyc2022/) development sprint. 
PRs to be reviewed: https://github.com/orgs/numpy/projects/5

- Inessa: Growing the NumPy triage team with https://www.codetriage.com/ 
Github users individually sign up to receive a selected number of issues per day.
Case study: Pandas (https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas#contributing-to-pandas).
*Discussion:* 
  * Let's clarify the triage guidelines first. 
  * Draft of the SciPy triage guide: https://github.com/scipy/scipy/pull/17208
  * To keep in mind: triaging NumPy issues requires a significant knowledge of the code base (might not be the best starting point for newcomers)
  * 2022-11-16 update: Draft of triage guidelines for numpy/numpy: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ziv-ij4AFeJi9aUC60TrAdYQXfK_Z5BxreMzalz0DIA/edit?usp=sharing
Inessa will submit a PR of the draft.

- More discussion needed for [`ufunc.resolved_dtypes`]( https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/22422)?


## New topics


- Chuck: Status of Macos-11 builds. This is currently a blocker for branching 1.24.x
  - Matti is looking into OpenBLAS issue (new gfortran compiler)

- Inessa: next NumPy Newcomers’ Hour - Thursday, November 17th at 8 pm UTC
Speaker: Ross Barnowski
Topic: Maintaining /numpy-tutorials

- Inessa: DEP: Deprecate `np.find_common_type`: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/22539 - does this PR require a discussion on the mailing list?
  - Yes, should hit the mailing list.
  - Merging this PR after the datetime/timedelta promotion is fixed would be better.

- [name=seberg] Other NumPy 1.24.x review of milestoned issues/PR.
  - Anything particularly important to be included?
  - Milestone: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/milestone/106

- Inessa: ENH: Add new function `nancov`: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/14784
  - Sebastian will ping the mailing list, maybe that gets the ball rolling.
  - [original issue](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/14414) asks for NaN handling for convolution and xcorrelation. astropy has these but that is an argument to push it into NumPy (if SciPy doesn't have it and doesn't have an obvious place.)


- ENH: Added `mant_dig` attribute to finfo: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/22405
It's uncertain if this PR brings true improvement.

- ENH enable `__imatmul__` for ArrayAPI compatability: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/21912:
Sebastian will bring it up with the ArrayAPI team before moving forward

- BUG: segmentation fault when combine `np.vectorize` and `recarray`: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/20749
Chuck: let's leave it til NumPy 1.25
