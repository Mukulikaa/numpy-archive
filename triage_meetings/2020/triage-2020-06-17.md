## Triage

- [PRs and issues labelled with "Triage-Review"](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/labels/Triage-review) (2 open, please add)
  - PR on importing typing at runtime was discussed and merged.
  - PR on `__array_wrap__` [14489](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/14489) still needs more discussion.

- [PRs and issues labeled with "needs decision"](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/labels/54%20-%20Needs%20decision) (55 open)

- [Open PRs (>240 open)](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pulls) can we get this below 200?




## Topics

* https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/1616 works around some compiler deficiency:
  * It sounds like since it is not very complex, we may as well do this

* Manylinux 2010 support?
  - plan is to drop manylinux1 for 1.20, depending on what pypi download statistics look like. We may add manylinux2014 for 1.20 instead, with the intention of dropping manylinux2010 for 1.21?

* `sq_concat` implementation?
  * An error seems fine, anything else probably doesn't make too much sense.

* Status on SIMD:
  * First PR should be ready to go and will be merged soon, some doc fixups can follow later
  * Next one is going to be close in line.

* Ross' new website: https://rossbar.github.io/github_graphql/index.html
