**Present:** 


## Follow-up from last meeting / discussions

- [PRs and issues labelled with "Triage-Review"](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/labels/Triage-review) (9 open)
  - A few more wheels should be possible (maybe ~30). Try manylinux2014 with manylinux1 from the 2014 ones (auditwheel, which requires no additional compilation).

- [PRs and issues labeled with "needs decision"](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/labels/54%20-%20Needs%20decision) (70 open)

- [genfromtxt issues](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+genfromtxt): 34 open issues; has been problematic for years

- [Installation issues](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/labels/32%20-%20Installation): this is still a significant fraction of all reported issues, can we improve on this?
  - Discussed, there are two structural issues (SYSPATH change and its handling in Anaconda, and the umath/multiarray merger fallout), both of which seem to have settled down. So just leave as is for now.
  - The other improvement here will be the new website, which will have much clearer install documentation and is discoverable.
