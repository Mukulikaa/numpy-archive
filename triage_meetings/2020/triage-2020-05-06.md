# 2020-05-06 NumPy Development Meeting -- Triage

Note: we now alternate between [community meetings](https://hackmd.io/76o-IxCjQX2mOXO_wwkcpg) and triage meetings.

- Time: 11am Pacific Time
- Join via Zoom at https://berkeley.zoom.us/j/762261535 (or [dial-in](https://berkeley.zoom.us/u/aC3ENhycM))
- [Trello workboard](https://trello.com/b/Azg4fYZH/numpy-at-bids)
- [Previous community meetings](https://github.com/numpy/archive/tree/master/status_meetings)
- [Previous triage meetings](https://github.com/numpy/archive/tree/master/triage_meetings)


**Present:** Ross, Matti, Warren, Hameer, Anirudh, Guilherme, Sebastian, ZJ, Rakesh


## Triage

- [PRs and issues labelled with "Triage-Review"](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/labels/Triage-review) (0 open, please add)

- [PRs and issues labeled with "needs decision"](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/labels/54%20-%20Needs%20decision) (56 open)

- [Open PRs (>240 open)](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pulls) can we get this below 200?

- [PRs and issues with 1.19 milestone](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/milestones/1.19.0%20release) (27)



## Topics

- Using `-strip-debug` on the wheels [PR 86](https://github.com/MacPython/numpy-wheels/pull/86) didn't shrink the size.
  - Nice, but not worth waiting for

- Should we release aarch64 wheels for 1.19? It seems SciPy is going to soon, and it would be strange for there to be a SciPy wheel with no NumPy wheel. [PR 74](https://github.com/MacPython/numpy-wheels/pull/74) needs to skip failing test. Should I work on it?

- Should we discuss the `np.arange` issues?
  - Integer behaviour argubaly broken
  - Unsure if we have enough demand for a new functions...
  - Document current behaviour better!

- Chinese "official docs"
  - https://github.com/teadocs/numpy-cn
  - Basically just removing the "official" wording from their site.
  - Sebastian will communicate with `pandas` and `matplotlib` and ZJ will communicate with the Chinese folks.

- NumPy 2.0 side discussion
  - Maybe we need some form of proposal/NEP about it (generally positive to the idea)
  - Whether we would want to aim for an ABI break, would be the elephant in the room probably

- 1. // 0. currently goes to NaN and gives the incorrect(?) warning currently, due to how `divmod` works (which has the same issue)
  - There are two issues: 
    - What do about integers, error or 0/-INT_MIN (plus warning?)
    - Return values of floats are currently ``(nan, nan)`` + InvalidValue not ``(inf, nan)`` + Division/Overflow
