## Topics

* NumFOCUS newsletter for August due soon, if you got news.

- Do we have any rules for metadata and type promotion? This can affect things like:
  ```
  dt = np.promote_types(np.dtype("i", metadata={1: 2}), "i")
  dt.metadata == {1: 2}  # ?!
  
  arr = np.array([1, 2, 3], dtype=np.dtype("i", metadata={1: 2}))
  res = arr + 3
  res.dtype.metadata  # ?!
  ```
  Currently, the rules seem fairly random. I don't have to change them much,
  but wonder if there is some features I am missing.

  - Ping tcaswell about how they use metadata and if they use it in promotion.

* Merge the sortlib into multiarray:
  - It is its own library, one to potentially make it public, the other since also umath was split off
  - Chuck: Not opposed to merging it.

- [Issue with windows 2004](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/16744): Due to OpenBLAS probably [issue there](https://github.com/xianyi/OpenBLAS/issues/2709)
  - Seems like a windows bug (at least most likely), we should make sure microsoft stays engaged (Matti will ping them)
  - Probably fixed in a pre-release: https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/content/problem/1095521/link-error-in-in-rust-test-binary.html

* Google Season of docs:
  1. Reorganizing docs (NEP 44), NumPy org website
  2. Tutorials for intermediate users 

- Many Open PRs, some specifically trick (such as SIMD), others just many to finish off.
  - Lets schedule a video call to look at some of the PRs
