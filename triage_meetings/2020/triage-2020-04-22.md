# 2020-04-22 NumPy Development Meeting -- Triage

Note: we now alternate between [community meetings](https://hackmd.io/76o-IxCjQX2mOXO_wwkcpg) and triage meetings.

- Time: 11am Pacific Time
- Join via Zoom at https://berkeley.zoom.us/j/762261535 (or [dial-in](https://berkeley.zoom.us/u/aC3ENhycM))
- [Trello workboard](https://trello.com/b/Azg4fYZH/numpy-at-bids)
- [Previous community meetings](https://github.com/numpy/archive/tree/master/status_meetings)
- [Previous triage meetings](https://github.com/numpy/archive/tree/master/triage_meetings)


**Present:** Chuck, Hameer, Matti, Warren, Ross, Sebastian, Rakesh, Anirudh


## Triage

What to do about the `bool('0')` issue in 1.18.3?
 - We will make a 1.18.4 to fix it, probably make a Futurewarning for 1.19.
 - Sebastian can look at this.
 - We should do this quickly, before next weekend

(mattip's rant): We have lots of open PRs that are not getting closed. Could we declare a moratorium on new PRS from core maintainers until we get a handle on the ones we have?
  - Ross would be willing to take on PRs marked with DOC
  - Hameer will give triage rights.

- [PR to move](https://github.com/MacPython/numpy-wheels/pull/78) wheel building from rackspace to anaconda and travis/appveyor to azure. Builds master [once a week])(https://anaconda.org/scipy-wheels-nightly/numpy/files) and PRs will upload to [staging](https://anaconda.org/multibuild-wheels-staging/numpy). If we add other architectures, we will need to revisit travis support.
  - We need to update the release and various readme files (mattip)
  - We still need to add creating manylinux1 wheels from the manylinux2010 wheels (mattip)

- Meeting yesterday on NEP 37, 30+35, etc.
  - There was some consensus on "trying both" ideally in master, this means living with `like=` and some "preliminary" API, although we would have the option to pull it out before 1.20.
  - We could say: We *will* revert these, unless the NEPs are accepted.

- [PRs and issues labelled with "Triage-Review"](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/labels/Triage-review) (4 open, please add)

- [PRs and issues labeled with "needs decision"](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/labels/54%20-%20Needs%20decision) (56 open)

- [Open PRs (>240 open)](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pulls) can we get this below 200?

- [PRs and issues with 1.19 milestone](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/milestones/1.19.0%20release) (27)
