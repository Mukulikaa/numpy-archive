- [Previous triage meetings](https://github.com/numpy/archive/tree/master/triage_meetings)


**Present:** Ross, Warren, Sebastian, Chuck, Hameer, Maia Kaplan, Matti


## Triage

- [PRs and issues labelled with "Triage-Review"](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/labels/Triage-review) (3 open, please add)

- [PRs and issues labeled with "needs decision"](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/labels/54%20-%20Needs%20decision) (55 open)

- [Open PRs (>270 open)](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pulls) can we get this below 200?

- Ross' list of cross-referenced issues: https://rossbar.github.io/github_graphql/index.html



## Topics

- Manylinux 1, 32bit has an issue (not critical)
 
- Windows 2004 issue is still open.
  - Hameer reproduced the issue: The issue has to do with openblas.
  - Matti tried compiling openblas-lib with a newer mingw, but the build timed out. We are using mingw 7.1. Should we move to azure? We get 6 hours there (vs 90 minutes per build in Appveyor)

- Break out/discuss individual work or questions.

  - Sebastian: I would like to discuss (with matti and anyone interested) how to go about merging the next big step (restructure casting).

- Protocol, NEP 35 status discussion:
  - Hameer also some progress in uarray.
  - Sebastian: Ping Peter Entschev about continuing the discussion.
  - Maybe contact more projects: scipy, sklearn, skimage, dask, other scikits?

- Walk through status on https://github.com/seberg/numpy/tree/restructure-casting
  - Some consensus on adding unit tests and being OK with merging into master without actually using the new functionality immediately.
  - Branching 1.20 may be in around 6 weeks, so it is unclear that the release would use any of the new things, but this means it may ship them (it does not take much space).


## Additional Details
