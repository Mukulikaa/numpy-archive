- [Trello workboard](https://trello.com/b/Azg4fYZH/numpy-at-bids)
- [Previous community meetings](https://github.com/numpy/archive/tree/master/status_meetings)
- [Previous triage meetings](https://github.com/numpy/archive/tree/master/triage_meetings)

**Present:** Sebastian, Matti, Chuck, Stefan, Ross, Hameer


## Follow-up from last meeting / discussions

- [PRs and issues labelled with "Triage-Review"](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/labels/Triage-review) (7 open)

- [PRs and issues labeled with "needs decision"](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/labels/54%20-%20Needs%20decision) (63 open)

- [genfromtxt issues](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+genfromtxt): 34 open issues; has been problematic for years


## Topics
 - Re: NEP 36 (fair play) - Stefan to followup and ping mailing list

 - [GH15570](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/15570) - `np.copy` vs. `.copy()` method behavior w.r.t subclasses of `ndarray`.
   * Original issue: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/3474
   * Old PR to fix (closed): https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/6509
   * Mailing list discussion: https://mail.python.org/pipermail/numpy-discussion/2015-October/074021.html
   
   Seemed to be decent consensus for #6509, but whithered on the vine.
