# 2020-06-03 NumPy Development Meeting -- Triage

Note: we now alternate between [community meetings](https://hackmd.io/76o-IxCjQX2mOXO_wwkcpg) and triage meetings.

- Time: 11am Pacific Time
- Join via Zoom at https://berkeley.zoom.us/j/762261535 (or [dial-in](https://berkeley.zoom.us/u/aC3ENhycM))
- [Trello workboard](https://trello.com/b/Azg4fYZH/numpy-at-bids)
- [Previous community meetings](https://github.com/numpy/archive/tree/master/status_meetings)
- [Previous triage meetings](https://github.com/numpy/archive/tree/master/triage_meetings)


**Present:** Warren, Sebastian, Ross, Anirudh, Hameer, Brigitta, Matti, Guilherme, Rakesh, Chuck, Themistoklis


## Triage

- [PRs and issues labelled with "Triage-Review"](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/labels/Triage-review) (4 open, please add)

- [PRs and issues labeled with "needs decision"](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/labels/54%20-%20Needs%20decision) (55 open)

- [Open PRs (>240 open)](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pulls) can we get this below 200?



## Topics

- Comment out two of the three win32 CI builds since they seem to have problems downloading mingw32 in parallel (not clear that is the real problem, who knows)

- 1.18.5 release for the pickle update.
  - Basically finished.

- `memmap` closing issue
  - [issue 13510](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/13510) 
  - Problem for the test suite, but otherwise not a big issue

- OpenBlas issue with minimum target https://github.com/MacPython/openblas-libs/issues/30


- **Idea from Matti** - organize virtual NumPy sprint over the summer? Perhaps discuss in the community meeting to get the ball rolling on organization?
  * Coordinate with SciPy conference? (they're still hosting virtual sprints -- I believe so?)
  * Good idea! any plan on when?
  * sklearn sprint might be an inspiration.

- (Sebastian, array coercion:) I had started this, but not too outline the general ideas, but for later: https://hackmd.io/UyxCDrMRROiQMFaH_TrwGA?both
