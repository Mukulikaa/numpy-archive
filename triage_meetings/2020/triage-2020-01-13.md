## Topics

- NumFOCUS project "one pager", 3 most important new things and projects+funding/effort (probable more for next weeks meeting)

* String booleans: Sebastian will try to look into it, in the end, we probably have to see if/how much downstream is affected.

- OpenBLAS: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/18141 and https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/18131 are OpenBLAS issues affecting us
    - Matti is going to look if there is a difference in the newer Openblas builds

- Promotion corner cases: `int16 + uint16 + float32 -> float32 or float64`
    - `uint24 + int32 -> int40`
