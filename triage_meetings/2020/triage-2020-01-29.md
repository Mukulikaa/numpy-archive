# 2020-01-29 NumPy Development Meeting -- Triage

Note: we now alternate between [community meetings](https://hackmd.io/76o-IxCjQX2mOXO_wwkcpg) and triage meetings.

- Time: 11am Pacific Time
- Join via Zoom at https://berkeley.zoom.us/j/762261535 (or [dial-in](https://berkeley.zoom.us/u/aC3ENhycM))
- [Trello workboard](https://trello.com/b/Azg4fYZH/numpy-at-bids)
- [Previous community meetings](https://github.com/numpy/archive/tree/master/status_meetings)
- [Previous triage meetings](https://github.com/numpy/archive/tree/master/triage_meetings)

**Present:** Ross, Sebastian, Hameer, Ralf, Chuck, Matti, Warren, ZJ, Inessa


## Follow-up from last meeting / discussions

- [PRs and issues labelled with "Triage-Review"](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/labels/Triage-review) (2 open)

- [PRs and issues labeled with "needs decision"](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/labels/54%20-%20Needs%20decision) (70 open)

- [genfromtxt issues](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+genfromtxt): 34 open issues; has been problematic for years


## Topics

* Ross's list of "Top Issues"

* Universal intrinsics and hardware detection discussion
  * How much complexity do we want to add to NumPy
  * Some things seem to not fit Universal intrinsics (e.g. strided AVX loops)
    * Is that really a problem?
    * Possibly ask Stephan Hoyer if he knows someone who may be able to give input on our design decisions.
    * We may not want specialized AVX512 loops if everything is clean with universal intrinsics, but not this one optimization.
    * Matti will look at adding this information to the NEP (complexity of adding universal intrinsics and that it does not mean specialized code is not possible? â€“ assuming that is true)

* At the end of the meeting (11:30 or later) we will talk about the NumPy survey.
  * Timeframe: Beginning of April we should have some result (e.g. Pilot study); Maybe we can see how fast we can move ahead.
  * Distribution?
    * User groups, conferences (SciPy, PyDATA, Podcasts)
  * Software for doing the survey:
    * They have a commercial product (they want respond analytics), we may want to prefer a different tool. (or switch from Pilot study to real study)
    * Is the data "public domain" if we use this software?
  * Yearly: Sounds like a good idea.
  * Probably no need to run for long (e.g. two weeks is plenty, since you usually either do it immediately when you see it, or never).
  * Meeting next Thursday
  * If we translate: There might be a delay in the schedule


## Additional Details

- Matti
  - more multibuild work, now waiting for review
  - start working through the new dtypes enhancements
- Warren

- Sebastian
  - Main item: Work on new NEP for DTypes work on NEP
  - Review/bug fix work (some of it needs to be wrapped up still)
  - Will try to redo array-coercion in a way that hopefully needs only minor changes when new DTypes are added.

- Ross

  Not necessarily triage-related, but time-sensitive:
  * NumPy survey update: Action items from first meeting with SURVMETH student research team
    - What is the timeline for release of the survey? How long will the survey be open?
    - What is/are the proposed release mechanisms?
      * Coincident with conference(s) (e.g. SciPy)?
      * Distribution via PyData groups?
    - What will be the repitition cycle of the survey? Annual?
  * Build-chain for book
    - Preliminary impressions: pandoc/r-flavored markdown is fine; bigger issue is the
      connection to a build-engine that runs code/gens figures etc.
      * Looking at [IPyPublish](https://ipypublish.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#) to 
        provide these features initially
      * Thinking about cache-ing mechanism for build: hashing code in cell & environment.
        Feasible? What about `imports`?
  * Build-chain due dates
    - Chris in Australia with other book-project devs early next week
      * [Bootstrap theme](https://github.com/ExecutableBookProject/sphinx-jupyter-book-theme)
      * Elegant Scipy -> pdoc-flavored .md for evaluation (+ipypublish)
