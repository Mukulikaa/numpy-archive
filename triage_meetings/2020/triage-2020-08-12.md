# 2020-08-12 NumPy Development Meeting -- Triage

Note: we now alternate between [community meetings](https://hackmd.io/76o-IxCjQX2mOXO_wwkcpg) and triage meetings.

- Time: 11am Pacific Time
- Join via Zoom at https://berkeley.zoom.us/j/762261535 (or [dial-in](https://berkeley.zoom.us/u/aC3ENhycM))
- [Trello workboard](https://trello.com/b/Azg4fYZH/numpy-at-bids)
- [Previous community meetings](https://github.com/numpy/archive/tree/master/status_meetings)
- [Previous triage meetings](https://github.com/numpy/archive/tree/master/triage_meetings)


**Present:** Matti, Ross, Hameer, Chuck, Warren, Sebastian


## Triage

- [PRs and issues labelled with "Triage-Review"](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/labels/Triage-review) (3 open, please add)

- [PRs and issues labeled with "needs decision"](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/labels/54%20-%20Needs%20decision) (55 open)

- [Open PRs (>240 open)](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pulls) can we get this below 200?

## Topics

* NEP 32 finalization: Delete financial functions? (including `np.npv`):

  * We can use `numpy.__getattr__` giving a nice error message also for just access, but requiring 3.7 (which is probably OK)
  
  * Lets do an error for 1 release or so: Its trivial and friendly


* Percentile/Quantile use interpolation methods that are in [the documentation](https://numpy.org/devdocs/reference/generated/numpy.percentile.html?highlight=percentile#numpy.percentile) at the bottom. [`np.cov`](https://numpy.org/devdocs/reference/generated/numpy.cov.html) uses two definitins of weight. Maybe we could get someone from statsmodels to review this: Kevin or Joseph.

* Cython may have an option to generate Python 3 only code, which we could enable if it exists

- NEP 35 `like=` for array-creation function PR (if anyone around wants to discuss it)

* [Casting error aborts iteration PR](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/17029):
  Slightly problematic in cases such as this:
  ```
  NPY_ALLOW_THREADS
  do {
      /* something */
  } while (iternext(iter))
 
  // No way to check here whether iteration was aborted early
  // And this reset will ignore the error, which is potentially bad:
  if (!NpyIter_Reset(iter)) {
    goto fail;
  }
 
  NPY_END_ALLOW_THREADS
  // Have to use `PyErr_Occurred()` here
  ```
