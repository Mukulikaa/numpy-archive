- Ross' list of cross-referenced issues: https://rossbar.github.io/github_graphql/index.html



## Topics

- 1.20 release todos: should we be marking things to prioritize them
  - We could branch soon.
  - OpenBLAS: The 1.19.3 version should be fine (the issues were false positives, i.e. much too little RAM in the virtual machine?)
  - The  like=`  fixup PR https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/17787 
  - Push these PRs through?:
    - https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/17122
  - No more SIMD (unless it is a bug fix)
  - Annotations?
  

- MacOSx and 10_9 vs 11_0 [issue 17784](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/17784): can we upload renamed wheels?
  - We keep using 10_9, and upload the renamed wheel.

- Changing the repr for `np.bool_(True)`:
  - This is confusing, but we currently also confuse for `np.int8(3)`, etc.
  - If we merge, we should probably fix it also for other scalars.



## Additional Details
