# 2020-05-20 NumPy Development Meeting -- Triage

Note: we now alternate between [community meetings](https://hackmd.io/76o-IxCjQX2mOXO_wwkcpg) and triage meetings.

- Time: 11am Pacific Time
- Join via Zoom at https://berkeley.zoom.us/j/762261535 (or [dial-in](https://berkeley.zoom.us/u/aC3ENhycM))
- [Trello workboard](https://trello.com/b/Azg4fYZH/numpy-at-bids)
- [Previous community meetings](https://github.com/numpy/archive/tree/master/status_meetings)
- [Previous triage meetings](https://github.com/numpy/archive/tree/master/triage_meetings)


**Present:** Warren, Ross, Themistoklis, Rakesh Vasudevan, Guilherme, Sebastian, Hameer, Chuck, Matti


## Triage

- [PRs and issues labelled with "Triage-Review"](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/labels/Triage-review) (1 open, please add)

- [PRs and issues labeled with "needs decision"](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/labels/54%20-%20Needs%20decision) (56 open)

- [Open PRs (>240 open)](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pulls) can we get this below 200?




## Topics

- (Followup necessary?) Should we release aarch64 wheels for 1.19? It seems SciPy is going to soon, and it would be strange for there to be a SciPy wheel with no NumPy wheel. [PR 74](https://github.com/MacPython/numpy-wheels/pull/74) needs to skip failing test. Should I work on it?
  - done

- `memmap` closing issue
  - [issue 13510](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/13510) 

- Plan to make a 1.19.x release with 3.9 support.

- Lets not support dict-views (they are not sequences)

- OpenBlas issue with minimum target https://github.com/MacPython/openblas-libs/issues/30

- Logo opinions: https://github.com/numpy/numpy.org/issues/37

- Accelerate removal PR now raises if you have a symlink: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/15759/files#diff-3912e721f925a43e582f4a308514c1efR938

- Maybe create a "stale" tag, to easier filter PRs that do not need going back to at the time.
