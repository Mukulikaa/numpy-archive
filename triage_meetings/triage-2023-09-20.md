## Follow up from previous meetings


- Defaulting to NEP 50 and [PR 23912](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/23912)
  - Weak scalars need to stay as weak integers deep into functions. This is complicated for things like percentile/quantile.
  - ufuncs can have weird casting semantics.

- Rewiring integers:
  - Could make the DTypes subclasses (`LongLongDType(Int64DType)`)
  - Special instances would be similar, but maybe harder because you can't mirror that in the scalars?

 
## New topics

- `core` -> `_core`. The danger might be when using the C-API" a project compiled with the older C-API (`core`) might miss the new location `_core`. Matteusz will try to stress-test this.

- TODO for GHC Sprint on Friday: labeling any easy, sprintable issues as such

- (mattip) There is an occasional timeout when deploying devdoc pages to github. The timeout seems to be 10 minutes, can we make it longer?
  - It seems to be an [occasional glitch](https://github.com/numpy/devdocs/actions). The typical deployment requires under a minute, but sometimes things slow down. No action needed it seem.
