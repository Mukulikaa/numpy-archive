# 2020-03-16 NumPy Documentation Team meeting

- Time: 8am Pacific Time
- Join via Zoom at: https://zoom.us/j/420005230

**Present:** Melissa MendonÃ§a, Ralf Gommers, Mars Lee, Ryan Cooper, Anne Bonner, Tarcisio Fischer

## Topics

- Melissa's [blog post](https://labs.quansight.org/blog/2020/03/documentation-as-a-way-to-build-community/) on docs & [NEP 44](https://numpy.org/neps/nep-0044-restructuring-numpy-docs.html)
  - blog post is also a call to action, taking docs more serious and adding people who care about education to the team

- Larger doc proposals like [issue 15760 on array data storage](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/15760)
  - That issue is missing what data should be used (e.g. dataset X, using floats, structured data and object arrays)
  - Melissa is writing a template or list of questions/topics that should be answered

- Starting a separate Jupyter notebook tutorials repo
  - Store as Jupytext or notebooks with output stripped?
  - Matplotlib has notebook downloads --> that is Sphinx-gallery. TODO: look back at SciPy thread on this, why wasn't sphinx-gallery sufficient?
  - Can decide later how to publish. The important part is to get high-quality content. Could publish as standalone repo, convert to reST, or ... (people struggle with reST, it makes the contribution process too hard)

- Datasets package for tutorials
    - Intake catalog
    - Melissa will look into downloader (Pooch?)
    - Find a name:) `pydatasets`?

- Codesprite tutorials. Example [page 1](https://imgur.com/rQc72iL) and [page 2](https://imgur.com/zhQ2huo)
    - Is it better to base a comic off an existing tutorial or make a new one?
        - Even if new content is developed, do that in code/notebook first (faster to iterate). After content is agreed is the time to work on a comic.
    - Should the topic be for beginners or specific topics that need more coverage, such as for 'storing and loading array data'?
        - Beginners would be the best target group probably.
    - Essentials such as broadcasting and indexing. 
    - Common pitfalls such as multi-processing and multi-threading

- CZI grant [goals & deliverables](https://figshare.com/articles/Proposal_NumPy_OpenBLAS_for_Chan_Zuckerberg_Initiative_EOSS_2019_round_1/10302167)
