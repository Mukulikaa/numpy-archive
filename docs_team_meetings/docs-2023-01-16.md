### Code of Conduct

We want to take a moment to remind you that this meeting is meant to be welcoming and inclusive. It's important for us to have a healthy community. Like all NumPy spaces, and everyone participating in them, this meeting will follow our [Code of Conduct](https://numpy.org/code-of-conduct/). If you haven't read it yet, please take some time to do so later on as it already applies to you. For now, in short, please be kind and generous towards one another. 

If you see violations, take a screenshot, intervene in a respectful manner, and report it to the CoC Committee via email. For more information, refer to the Reporting Guidelines section on https://numpy.org/code-of-conduct/.

## New Topics

- Ross: Dealing with data for NumPy tutorials
  * Currently running a mirror (from my personal github account) containing data for numpy tutorials.
    - At the very least, this should move outside of my personal github account
    - Look into S3 buckets?
  * Data as a submodule?
    - Doesn't scale to large datasets, but probably more convenient than what we currently do

- Ross: Add info about fetching/pulling from a PR to our developer docs? https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/22908
    - Mukulika votes for leaving that to the github docs

- Ross: Close? https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/22723

- A quick look at [open doc PRs](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pulls?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Apr+label%3A%2204+-+Documentation%22):
  * https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/23006 : Almost there, just needs the correct link target
  * https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/22960 : Basically good to go IMO
  * https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/22562 : failing lint job; either ignore or modify example to use a 3x3 instead of 4x4 ary
    - Maybe add ref_guide check to a specific CI job for easier review

- Consider adding numpy-tutorials to the main NumPy readme (?) to redirect CI contributions to a more suitable/necessary place.
