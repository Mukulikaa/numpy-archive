### Code of Conduct

We want to take a moment to remind you that this meeting is meant to be welcoming and inclusive. It's important for us to have a healthy community. Like all NumPy spaces, and everyone participating in them, this meeting will follow our [Code of Conduct](https://numpy.org/code-of-conduct/). If you haven't read it yet, please take some time to do so later on as it already applies to you. For now, in short, please be kind and generous towards one another. 

If you see violations, take a screenshot, intervene in a respectful manner, and report it to the CoC Committee via email. For more information, refer to the Reporting Guidelines section on https://numpy.org/code-of-conduct/.

## Follow-up from last meeting / discussions

- [name=rossbar] Dealing with data for NumPy tutorials
  * **Action item**: Start with scikit-learn data
  * Future SPEC? How to host data since every project is doing it's own thing
  * Core problem: No free infrastructure for data like there is for source code


    

## New Topics


- Inessa: YouTube videos update: Jules has provided timestamps for 4 videos.:tada:
    - PRs are pending 
    - Example PR: https://github.com/numpy/numpy-newsletter/pull/21

- **Review #1 stage** for GSOD-NumPy 2023
    - Will share on this community call but want to formally open to wider community who may not be in call
    - Drew some Concept Art
        - 1. How do you use NumPy? ![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rJit636w2.jpg) 
        - 2. How did you start using NumPy? ![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ByOca3TDh.jpg)
        - 3. How do we start a sprint? ![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ByHip36Dh.jpg)
        - [Link to full Concept Art prompts](https://github.com/MarsBarLee/gsod-numpy-2023/blob/main/outlining/concept-art.md)
    - Discussion points
        - Writing out specific parts I would like feedback on 
            - **Metaphor**: Making digital pages into physical media (Github issues as paper scrolls)
            - **Characters**: over-confident, under-confident and just right
                - Over-confident: "I bet I already know how to do this!"
                - Under-confident: "Can I start working on this issue?""
                - Just right: "Let's review the documentation if this already exists and if I'm still not sure, I'll ask someone."
            - **Accuracy** of 'sprintable' issue
                - Taken from current issue https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/22435
    - Next steps
        - Putting together review: Github issue and Google Doc
            - 3 main drawings, as shown above
            - [Chapters](https://github.com/MarsBarLee/gsod-numpy-2023/blob/main/outlining/chapters.md)
                - Introduction
                    - To characters and how in-person sprints work
                - The sprint itself
                    - Collaboration and the importance of different approaches
                - After the sprint
                    - Meeting remotely, connecting to mailing  list and Slack
                - Goals and future
                    - Contributor's goals, how open source processes are open to change too
        - Annoucing that open for review: mailing list and Slack channel
            - 2 weeks period for getting reviews
            - For next Review stage, want to coordinate so people know they can join community calls to give reviews
        - Possibility: reaching out to specific people for in-depth review?
    - Comments: 
        - Uncertainty of a character in the Concept art #1: How do you use NumPy?
        - Does the character interested in technical writing use NumPy? Not very clear.
        - There is a distinction between using NumPy and interacting with NumPy
        - Define "technical writing" more specifically: Someone who writes blog posts or documentation
        - Rephrase to be clearer
        - Change question to: "How do you intereact with NumPy". Broader.
        - Or change character's response: "I used NumPy a little but I really want to help with NumPy's documentation"
        - Metaphor: makes sense
        - Characters: have their different approaches conflict and resolve
        - Accuracy: Will show more of process in future. One character feels like the issue is sprintable, one character does not, one character still needs to set up their local Git environment. Or maybe the team doesn't finished the issue during the sprint: they're frustrated but that's common
    - Previous steps:
        - Completed Outlining stage for GSOD-NumPy 2023 (May 15-26)
        - Completed Gathering community input stage and 3 brainstorming sesions
            - At Newcomer(May 4) NumPy Docs (May 8), Commmunity (May 10)
            - [Link to Google Jamboard](https://jamboard.google.com/d/1j_rEIslOh59N9cLGU1VGc7rTc88SuLTi7l4YqTqAULc/edit?usp=sharing)
