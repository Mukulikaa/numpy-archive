### Code of Conduct

We want to take a moment to remind you that this meeting is meant to be welcoming and inclusive. It's important for us to have a healthy community. Like all NumPy spaces, and everyone participating in them, this meeting will follow our [Code of Conduct](https://numpy.org/code-of-conduct/). If you haven't read it yet, please take some time to do so later on as it already applies to you. For now, in short, please be kind and generous towards one another. 

If you see violations, take a screenshot, intervene in a respectful manner, and report it to the CoC Committee via email. For more information, refer to the Reporting Guidelines section on https://numpy.org/code-of-conduct/.

If you’d like to work on any of them, leave a comment on GitHub (below the relevant issue).

- NumPy 1.24.0 is now available.
The release continues the ongoing work to improve the handling and promotion of dtypes, increase execution speed, and clarify the documentation. There is a number of new and expired deprecations due to changes in dtype promotion and cleanups.
The supported Python versions are 3.8-3.11.
A total of 177 people contributed to this release, 107 of them contributed to numpy/numpy for the first time.

## New Topics

- Look out for more "sprintable" issues.

- Contributor retention: we are now tracking second contributions in the [Github project board "NumPy first-time contributor PRs"](https://github.com/orgs/numpy/projects/5/views/1). Inessa identified it as the north star for the NumPy community building efforts.
    - Second contributions are identified and added to the board manually.  
    - To automate, the metric should be added to the [Scientific Python Developer Statistics dashboard](https://devstats.scientific-python.org/_generated/numpy.html). The issue is pending: https://github.com/scientific-python/devstats.scientific-python.org/issues/38   

- Following up on the PRs that are pending author's response
    - Ping an author if the PR hasn't been updated for 6+ months, check on them again in 2-3 weeks.
    - If there is no response, feel free to start a new PR, with the co-authorship of the original author, to finish the work.
    - If you think a PR should be closed, discuss it at a triage meeting. When closing, one must leave a note in the PR with an explanation.

- Tracking inactive PRs 
    - Add them to this GitHub project: https://github.com/orgs/numpy/projects/6
