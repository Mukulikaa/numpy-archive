### Code of Conduct

We want to take a moment to remind you that this meeting is meant to be welcoming and inclusive. It's important for us to have a healthy community. Like all NumPy spaces, and everyone participating in them, this meeting will follow our [Code of Conduct](https://numpy.org/code-of-conduct/). If you haven't read it yet, please take some time to do so later on as it already applies to you. For now, in short, please be kind and generous towards one another. 

If you see violations, take a screenshot, intervene in a respectful manner, and report it to the CoC Committee via email. For more information, refer to the Reporting Guidelines section on https://numpy.org/code-of-conduct/.

## Follow-up from last meeting / discussions

- [name=rossbar] Dealing with data for NumPy tutorials
  * Currently running a mirror (from my personal github account) containing data for numpy tutorials.
    - At the very least, this should move outside of my personal github account
    - Look into S3 buckets?
    - Talk to Numfocus about allocating a bucket
    - vs Github repo, small, just a few MB
        - But could be limiting if have a future tutorial that needs more eg NLP
  * Data as a submodule?
    - Doesn't scale to large datasets, but probably more convenient than what we currently do
    - Similar to what SciPy is implementing (scikit-learn does something similar)
        - [Initial setup for scipy.datasets](https://github.com/scipy/scipy/pull/15607)
        - Each dataset is a repo under the scipy organization. For example, https://github.com/scipy/dataset-ascent
        - [Documentation on scipy.datasets](https://scipy.github.io/devdocs/reference/datasets.html)
        
     - **Action Item** rossbar will bring this up at community meeting, ask for someone w/ permissions to make a `numpy-tutorials-data` repo in the numpy org


- Consider adding numpy-tutorials to the main NumPy readme (?) to redirect CI contributions to a more suitable/necessary place.
  * Good idea - someone send a PR and we'll merge!

- [name=Mukulika ]Interest for participating in Google Season of Docs 2023
    - The new season has been [announced](https://groups.google.com/g/season-of-docs-announce/c/-wfcYZ9UYwc/m/gotnfJ0OCgAJ?pli=1).
    - Read about last season's successful projects [here](https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs/docs/2022/participants).
    - Mukulika, Melissa, Ross available for mentoring
  * Dates: Open 2/15, close in March
  * Bring up at community meeting
    - Hackmd w/ ideas to mailing list
    - Seek out mentors
    - Figure out how it works admin-wise. Do we go through numfocus?

## New Topics

- NumPy tutorial potential - [GPT in 60 Lines of NumPy](https://jaykmody.com/blog/gpt-from-scratch/)? 
    - Maybe put a stub on our site leading to the blog
    - Popular topic

- NumPy tutorials directory restructure
    - https://github.com/numpy/numpy-tutorials/pull/169
    - Or fix the theme for the site
        - so that 'edit button' works but symbolic links still broken. Direct Windows users to Gitpod

- Ask NumFOCUS to help with pay or contracts for GSoD

- Going through [open Doc PRS](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pulls?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Apr+label%3A%2204+-+Documentation%22)
    - revisit np.round_ deprecation
    - For DOC: Partially update compress_{cols,rows}, Mukulika to look at it to fix it, if not close it
    - closing a few
        - For DOC: Improve documentation formatting, take as a case by case basis instead?
        - Unicode for polynomial rendering? Some Unicode not supported by Windows powershell's default font
        - No universal consensus
