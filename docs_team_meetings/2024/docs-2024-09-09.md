### Code of Conduct

We want to take a moment to remind you that this meeting is meant to be welcoming and inclusive. It's important for us to have a healthy community. Like all NumPy spaces, and everyone participating in them, this meeting will follow our [Code of Conduct](https://numpy.org/code-of-conduct/). If you haven't read it yet, please take some time to do so later on as it already applies to you. For now, in short, please be kind and generous towards one another. 

If you see violations, take a screenshot, intervene in a respectful manner, and report it to the CoC Committee via email. For more information, refer to the Reporting Guidelines section on https://numpy.org/code-of-conduct/.

        - If yes: Are you more interested in attending a NumPy community meetings?
        - Have you attended contributed to NumPy before?
        - Do you feel more confident to contribute to NumPy, such as through issues or pull requests?

            - Typos on back cover and pg 13 fixed
        - Setback: Oops, comic script has been deleted. It was hosted on an old work account
            - Backup of older versions found on Github repo
            - Workaround: sketches have up-to-date dialogue, just a little hard to read sometimes

- [DOC: add cheat sheet](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/26593)
    - Inspirations: [Pandas](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/blob/main/doc/cheatsheet/Pandas_Cheat_Sheet.pdf), [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/cheatsheets/), [Xarray](https://docs.xarray.dev/en/stable/howdoi.html)
    - Difficult to encompass the entire software
    - Subdivide into different modules we want cheat sheets for
    - Categories based on concepts or features
    - Duplication not a concern as such; different way of representing info 
    - NumPy cheatsheets will be good for SEOs. Some already available online. See if we can adapt them.
    - Link to POSSEE: https://github.com/possee-org/genai-numpy/issues/94
    - Is there a review comparing existing cheatsheets? Are others too long, disorganized, etc?
    - Are there artifacts or documentation that will be left behind?


## New topics

- Future of the NumPy comics
    - Brainstormed next comic at the NumFOCUS Project Summit: https://github.com/numfocus/project-summit-2024-sprints/issues/5

- Community-organized sprints?
    - Maybe biweekly 
        - Perhaps too frequent at first
        - Monthly might be more manageable for sprint organizers
        - Counter: biweekly has more momentum, could be more exciting for sprint attendees
        - Start with montly and then see if enough interest in biweekly
    - Each session will be focused on a single task- eg. installing numpy for dev, review a PR, choose an issue to work on etc.
    - Possibly will have to have advanced tasks for long time contributors
    - meeting members agree, that this would be very useful, certainly a need
    - set-up is a common problem at sprints
    - opportunity to interact with core maintainers
    - motivation for people to attend?
    - bring up topic in newcomers hour and community meetings
