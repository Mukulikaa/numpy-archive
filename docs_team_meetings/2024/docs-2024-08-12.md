### Code of Conduct

We want to take a moment to remind you that this meeting is meant to be welcoming and inclusive. It's important for us to have a healthy community. Like all NumPy spaces, and everyone participating in them, this meeting will follow our [Code of Conduct](https://numpy.org/code-of-conduct/). If you haven't read it yet, please take some time to do so later on as it already applies to you. For now, in short, please be kind and generous towards one another. 

If you see violations, take a screenshot, intervene in a respectful manner, and report it to the CoC Committee via email. For more information, refer to the Reporting Guidelines section on https://numpy.org/code-of-conduct/.

## Follow-up from last meeting / discussions

- GSOD 2024 Updates: Completing the ["How to Contribute to NumPy" comics](https://heyzine.com/flip-book/3e66a13901.html):
    - Completed illustrations by adding character designs for page [12](https://github.com/MarsBarLee/gsod-numpy-2023/blob/main/pg%2012_08_12_24.png?raw=true), [13](https://github.com/MarsBarLee/gsod-numpy-2023/blob/main/pg%2013_08_12_24.png?raw=true), [14](https://github.com/MarsBarLee/gsod-numpy-2023/blob/main/pg%2014_08_12_24.png?raw=true), [15](https://github.com/MarsBarLee/gsod-numpy-2023/blob/main/pg%2015_8_12_24.png), [16](https://github.com/MarsBarLee/gsod-numpy-2023/blob/main/pg%2016_08_12_24.png), and [17](https://github.com/MarsBarLee/gsod-numpy-2023/blob/main/pg%2017_08_12_24.png)
    - Typos on back cover and pg 13 fixed
    - Next steps
        - August: 18/credits/cover, finish up illustration of page 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, cover to ready to Community Review #3
            - Illustrations and layout for back cover
            - Update text layout
            - Case studies on back page, such as [black hole image](https://numpy.org/case-studies/blackhole-image/)
            - Consider community review
    - Previous updates
        - July 29: nearly done with page 16, 17. outlining back cover
            - [Link to updated page 16](https://github.com/MarsBarLee/gsod-numpy-2023/blob/main/pg%2016%2007-29-2024.png?raw=true)
            - [Link to updated page 17](https://github.com/MarsBarLee/gsod-numpy-2023/blob/main/pg%2017%2007-29-2024.png?raw=true)
            - [Link to back cover](https://github.com/MarsBarLee/gsod-numpy-2023/blob/main)
        - Setback: Oops, comic script has been deleted. It was hosted on an old work account
            - Backup of older versions found on Github repo
            - Workaround: sketches have up-to-date dialogue, just a little hard to read sometimes

- [DOC: add cheat sheet](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/26593)
    - Inspirations: [Pandas](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/blob/main/doc/cheatsheet/Pandas_Cheat_Sheet.pdf), [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/cheatsheets/), [Xarray](https://docs.xarray.dev/en/stable/howdoi.html)
    - Difficult to encompass the entire software
    - Subdivide into different modules we want cheat sheets for
    - Categories based on concepts or features
    - Duplication not a concern as such; different way of representing info 
    - NumPy cheatsheets will be good for SEOs. Some already available online. See if we can adapt them.
    - Link to POSSEE: https://github.com/possee-org/genai-numpy/issues/94
    - Is there a review comparing existing cheatsheets? Are others too long, disorganized, etc?
    - Are there artifacts or documentation that will be left behind?


- New tutorial idea by Anne: Application of broadcasting in image processing - explanation of the concept
    - Possible references: 
        - https://github.com/rougier/from-python-to-numpy
        - https://librehub.github.io/napari-LatAm-workshop-2023/day1/3_python_introduction/05b_images_are_numpy_arrays.html
        - Also maybe https://github.com/elegant-scipy/elegant-scipy


## New topics

- Draft PR for cheatsheets: https://github.com/possee-org/genai-numpy/pull/122
    - Useful to point out features in existing cheatsheets that are not desirable
    - Generated cheatsheet: https://github.com/possee-org/genai-numpy/tree/main/numpy-cheatsheet
    - Mukulika to see where the discussion moves forward

- What function does add_newdocs.py (something similar) serve? Examples in `ma` module.

- A PR for adding interactive docs to NumPy: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/26745. Feedback from folks interested in documentation and the general UX around this are welcome.
