        - Since the codebase is mature and gone through 2.0.0 release, overall structure of codebase being stable for a long time
        - If documenting core function, safe from little updates that would have to happen every year
        - Process of translation: for open source

- 21 Oct: We briefly discussed need for PDF. Kakaire's take is that, a) in his community at his university in Uganda, everyone has internet access and b) many other projects in the NumPy ecosystem have also dropped pdf output
    - Further discussion at https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/27573


## New topics

- Doxygen + Breathe: Do we need it anymore? https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/27610
    - Find out places where Doxygen is still used and original motivation for adding it.
    - How are C++ docstrings rendered if at all?
