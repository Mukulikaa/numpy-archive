### Code of Conduct

We want to take a moment to remind you that this meeting is meant to be welcoming and inclusive. It's important for us to have a healthy community. Like all NumPy spaces, and everyone participating in them, this meeting will follow our [Code of Conduct](https://numpy.org/code-of-conduct/). If you haven't read it yet, please take some time to do so later on as it already applies to you. For now, in short, please be kind and generous towards one another. 

If you see violations, take a screenshot, intervene in a respectful manner, and report it to the CoC Committee via email. For more information, refer to the Reporting Guidelines section on https://numpy.org/code-of-conduct/.

**Present:** Anne Gunn, Mukulika, Kakaire Steven, Melissa

    - Previous updates:
        - [Script from last two pages, where it gets busy](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fjLTDqSkcKMxo8oSTRThllBFpjo5rXS9/edit#bookmark=id.4d34og8)
        - Does not include credits: perhaps text instead of illustration of short on time.
        - Comments on overview: happy how translated scrpit to visuals, accruate. Like how story ties together, leave with tips on how to interact with open source communities
        - POV changes, from PR maker to maintainer, humanize process
        - Collaborate with future editions of NumPy Community Survey on effectiveness of comics
        - Talk at PyConUS about comic went well!
        - Talk title: Paint by Numbers: A Retrospective on the NumPy Comics (and Under-Represented Skillsets in Documentation)
        - At the Documentation Summit, a track that helped bring people in a big conference
    - Setback: Oops, comic script has been deleted. It was hosted on an old work account
        - Backup of older versions found on Github repo
        - Workaround: sketches have up-to-date dialogue, just a little hard to read sometimes

- Feedback on comic from this meeting's attendees 
    - POSSEE (Practical Open Source Sustainability Experiences for Education) project, 7 newcomers, Ben 
        - Connecting funding and students with open source
        - Comics are a hit at a local high school in NYC, local PyData meetups
    - Kakaire Steven, organizer in Uganda, Makerere University. Buildling a community complier, could give out copies at meetups
    
- Ways to build community
    - Developer sprints bring together people of different knowledge levels
    - Plone has frequent sprints

- Multiple questions from [name=Ben Woodruff] and some in relation to POSSEE.
    - `python tools/refguide_check.py --doctests` Has one failure (ma.power) `Expected:0.2988071523335984`,  `Obtained: 0.29880715233359845`,  Is this a problem? Anyone else seen it? Simple to fix. Any idea why this error doesn't flag via the automated actions? It [passes](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/numpy/numpy/26903/workflows/989512c7-6c1b-4e7c-8032-7f1e3444bc14/jobs/40394) the test online. Here's the [git blame](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/commit/2059dd9e6dce61d4c52571b3865faebd8fd5ccec).
    - Updating the docs throughout to use new suggested versions in `random` module? [Here](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/26606)'s an example. 
    - [Functions that are missing examples](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/21351#issuecomment-2125078646): Many are API compatible versions of existing functions. Do we add examples, or let people follow the "See also"? The POSSEE team is happy to add examples. As a user I would prefer to not have to follow a link. Here's an [example](https://numpy.org/devdocs/reference/generated/numpy.ma.convolve.html). 
    - At triage meeting, it was suggested we add a check for all PRs to make sure new functions have web linked documentation. I wrote a [possible version](https://github.com/bmwoodruff/numpy-ideas/blob/main/locate-missing-docs.ipynb) to identify several such functions from `ma` and `strings` modules. Anyone interested in cleaning this up and incorporating it into the automated git flow? There are some underlying type issues to deal with.
    - Importing Conventions: See [1](https://numpy.org/devdocs/reference/generated/numpy.linalg.cond.html) and [2](https://numpy.org/devdocs/reference/generated/numpy.linalg.inv.html). Mostly, I want some direction so POSSEE can [produce ideal examples](https://github.com/possee-org/genai-numpy/issues/27#issuecomment-2146038211) with AI (we are not there yet). 
        - Look through NumPy style guide

## New topics

- [DOC: add cheat sheet](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/26593)
    - Inspirations: [Pandas](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/blob/main/doc/cheatsheet/Pandas_Cheat_Sheet.pdf), [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/cheatsheets/), [Xarray](https://docs.xarray.dev/en/stable/howdoi.html)
    - Difficult to encompass the entire software
    - Subdivide into different modules we want cheat sheets for
    - Categories based on concepts or features
    - Duplication not a concern as such; different way of representing info 
    - NumPy cheatsheets will be good for SEOs. Some already available online. See if we can adapt them.

- [DOC: Change hardlinked NEPs to intersphinx mappings](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/26707) - good issue for newcomers!

- Kakaire starting a new community with weekly meetings. Looking to bring in speakers.

- New tutorial idea by Anne: Application of broadcasting in image processing - explanation of the concept
    - Possible references:

- Docs for NumPy 2.0 are published https://numpy.org/doc/stable/

- Blog post (draft) https://github.com/scientific-python/blog.scientific-python.org/pull/219
