## Topics

- Google Season of Docs update
    - [Indexing PR](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/19407)
    - [Broadcasting PR](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/19369)
    - Next: [Create a documentation page for ufunc](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/16924)
    - Adding documentation on how to run doctests
        - At some point we should migrate to doctestplus ([issue](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/15845)) but Mukulika doesn't need to focus on that right now.
- [DOC: 'Governance' in Sphinx pages: delete/move/keep? #17496](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/17496)
    - Move this page to numpy.org (keep a link)
- Interoperability with NumPy (Dask, Cupy, protocols) (Melissa)
    - What would you like to see?
- [PR for accessibility testing in the PyData Sphinx theme](https://github.com/pydata/pydata-sphinx-theme/pull/294) is still open. You can comment if you feel inspired to push for this since it will influence NumPy too!
- [Mukulika mentions she might get to work on this issue](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/15793) on the internal representation of NumPy arrays. 
- Mukulika also mentions that we don't know if the survey participants are looking at stable or devdocs. Melissa will talk to Inessa to make sure we pick the right version of the docs to analyze.
