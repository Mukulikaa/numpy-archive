- Time: 4PM UTC
- Join via Zoom at: [link](https://zoom.us/j/96219574921?pwd=VTRNeGwwOUlrYVNYSENpVVBRRjlkZz09)

**Present:** Ross Barnowski, Mukulika Pahari, Mars Lee, Ganesh Kathiresan, Inessa Pawson, Ryan Cooper

## Topics

- GSoD updates
    - [Copies v. Views](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/19791)
      * Recently updated - needs review
    - Indexing how-to: incoming
- Experimenting with Doxygen
  * It turns out there's an existing Doxyfile in NumPy already - not sure if it's used or not: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/blob/main/doc/cdoc/Doxyfile
    - Action Item: Mukulika will raise an issue about this
- [Typed NumPY API usage issue](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/19875)
  * Let's bring this up at the next community meeting to get Bas' feedback
- [How to find your way in the code?](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/15567)
    - [Guidelines on how to find the correct file to edit (see issue comment here)](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/19952#issuecomment-927907185)
      * Are there docs about the C-templating engine?
        - If not, there should be! Basics - usage, syntax, etc.
      * GitHub Next: https://next.github.com/projects/repo-visualization
    - Is it worth documenting what functionality is defined in C/Cython/Python?
      * The main benefit would probably be for new contributors who were more comfortable with Python than lower-level languages in steering them towards source code that they're more comfortable with.
    - [Source links for C code issue](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/19520)

- Can we have a standard way to reply to people who want to edit docstrings? (this might make our lives easier and help first-time contributors)
  * Bots/CI services to help with pointing to contributing docs?
  * e.g. https://github.com/moja-global/FLINT-UI/issues/75#issuecomment-919055489
  * Simplify contributing docs to make them for readable?
  * Have a "how-to" that illustrates how to contribute e.g. a docs PR
    * Incorporate pictoral/visual info on the procedure
  * Incorporate link to newcomer's hour to contributing guides!
  * Action Item: Let's open an issue (in numpy-tutorials to start) about contribution walkthroughs.
  * [Related issue about first time contributors](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/19778)

- [Translation of NumPy-Tutorials](https://github.com/numpy/numpy-tutorials/issues/109): should we include an official policy in the README?
  * Adding a translation policy blurb to the README 

- [Drishti's NLP-Ethics Tutorial](https://github.com/numpy/numpy-tutorials/pull/105)
    - We are considering using [Pooch](https://pypi.org/project/pooch/). Drishti is investigating. If this is not appropriate, we might want to mark this document to be skipped by CI and let people run that locally only (with instructions about how to obtain the files).
    - Some ideas:
      * GitHub LFS?
      * Cloud data services? a NumPy/SciPy/Scientific Python discount? Maybe we could ping NumFOCUS about setting up an ecosystem-wide solution here.
