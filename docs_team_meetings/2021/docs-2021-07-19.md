## Topics

- GSoD updates
    - Broadcasting doc merged :tada: 
    - [Indexing doc](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/19407) under review
    - Ufuncs documentation
        - Relevant issues [#19494](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/19494) and [#16924](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/16924)
        - [Draft PR](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/19516)
    - Next: internal representation of arrays
    - Mukulika asks about the `[source]` button on the reference docs; some pages are missing this link. Apparently, these are the functions/objects with docstrings generated by `_add_newdocs.py` Mukulika will add an issue but this is low priority.
- [Organization of reference docs](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/19420)
    - We are open to a PR to add this page as long as it's generated automatically and easy to maintain. Maybe autosummary/automodule or some auto- tool can generate this page.
- [New NumPy tutorials contribution?](https://github.com/numpy/numpy-tutorials/issues/92)
- [Sphinx warnings issue](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/13114#issuecomment-881227962)

- [Sphinx bug: Logo and favicon not showing in devdocs](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/19509)
    - Seems to be fixed in [new sphinx release](https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/issues/9438) (thanks Mukulika for chasing that down). 
    - We probably want to do the same as SciPy https://github.com/scipy/scipy/pull/14417
    - Check if dependabot missed this (apparently not, it updated to 4.1.0 7 days ago so the weekly update will probably trigger today)?

- Are there any relevant documentation guidelines besides [A guide to NumPy documentation](https://numpy.org/devdocs/docs/howto_document.html), and the [Google developer documentation style guide](https://developers.google.com/style)? Does the [NumPy tutorials style guide](https://github.com/numpy/numpy-tutorials/blob/main/content/tutorial-style-guide.md) count?
    - Maybe [The Chicago Manual of Style](https://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/home.html)?
    - They aren't referenced in the main docs, but there's also [Microsoft](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/welcome/) and [Mailchimp's](https://styleguide.mailchimp.com/) style guides.
