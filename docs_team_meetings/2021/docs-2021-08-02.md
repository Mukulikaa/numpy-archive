**Present:** Melissa Mendon√ßa, Mukulika Pahari, Isabela Presedo-Floyd, Mars Lee, Ross Barnowski

## Topics

- We have three pages about documentation building, can we merge them?
    - https://numpy.org/devdocs/dev/howto-docs.html (only reachable from within the developer documentation)
    - https://numpy.org/devdocs/docs/index.html (reachable from the main toctree in the sidebar)
    - https://numpy.org/devdocs/doc_conventions.html (top level)
    - Mukulika will work on opening an issue
- GSoD updates
    - [Ufunc doc](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/19516)
    - [Indexing how-to discussion issue](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/19586) - Mukulika will send a note to the mailing list
    - [Indexing doc](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/19407)
        - What should we do about the stub doc in reference guide now that everything has been shifted to the fundamentals doc?
    - Working on the internal array representation doc
- Docs Front-page re-design
    - [Github issue link](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/18419)
    - Implement Sphinx panels following Pandas' example
    - [Prototype from a few months ago](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/18419#issuecomment-840078589)
    - Discussion continues in similar issues, such as in [DOC: Discussion - How to organize tutorials](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/19191)
    - Mars to open an issue to compile everything in one place and ping Melissa, Ross 
- At the last NumPy newcomers meeting there was an alt text sprint for the docs. We used a checklist from [this document](https://hackmd.io/y_GiwWGVQFaPyOT7ti6SaA?view) which also has a proposed alt text style guide. As this gets polished, would you like to have this as a part of the NumPy docs in some way?
    - This is the PR we worked on: https://github.com/melissawm/numpy/pull/27
    - This could go into the SPEC accessibility discussion - Isabela and Mars will work on that
- What to do about [Under-the-hood docs](https://numpy.org/devdocs/dev/underthehood.html)?
    - maybe we should just remove it? There's no content under it 
    - Internal array representation would fit here?
    - Some scipy lecture notes documents would also fit here
