## Topics

- GSoD updates
    - [Moving NumPy Internals to under-the-hood docs](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/19689)
    - (from last meeting) Writing a Copies vs. Views document
        - How to check if NumPy will do a copy or not?
        - Should we use the `shares_memory` or `may_share_memory` flags?
        - Mukulika will submit a PR shortly
- [Tighten contribution guidelines](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/19778)
    - (Related) [GitHub Issue Forms](https://github.com/scipy/scipy/pull/14493)?
    - Let's try this with the existing templates, making sure that we don't impose too much structure on contributors
- (from last meeting) [How to find your way in the code?](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/15567)
    - Mukulika and Yashasvi are thinking about this
- [Doxygen/Breathe C/C++ Documentation support PR](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/18884)
    - This adds one extra step to docs building (installing doxygen)
    - Is it possible to ignore that if we only want the python docs? -> yes; we'll miss a few rst files but this should not stop sphinx from finishing building the docs
    - Rohit suggest looking into [doxyrest](https://github.com/vovkos/doxyrest) as it is faster than Breathe; however it's not clear this is a bottleneck for us right now. [Rohit's notes on his SymEngine GSoD project](https://rgoswami.me/posts/symengine-gsod20/)
    - We should add doxygen to environment.yml, pin the version and add a note to the contributing docs
    - Rohit also questioned the usability of documentation (generated with `doxyrest` or `breathe`) which do not link to code and obscure the implementations
        - The standard doxygen HTML documentation itself includes code and is richer in terms of informational content\
        - Is the change of theme that big of an issue?
- Docs front-page re-design: small update
    -  [Draft PR](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/19756) made
    -  Removed references to html templates
- f2py docs
    - Rohit asks what is the right way to add documentation to fortranobject.c/fortranobject.h and document the fortran code
- Drishti's work on an ethics-focused tutorial for NumPy Tutorials: caching, CI and other issues (Drishti is a Quansight intern)
- Khushi is also a Quansight intern, and is submitting a benchmarking page to numpy.org
