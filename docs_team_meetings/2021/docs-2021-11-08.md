## Topics

- GSoD updates: final stretch!
    - Let's work on the case study here: https://hackmd.io/@melissawm/HkuZuIN8K
    - [Indexing How-to](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/20093)
        - Under review
    - [Copies and Views](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/19791) merged! :tada:
    - [Tutorial:Analysis of air pollution levels before and after lockdowns](https://github.com/numpy/numpy-tutorials/issues/110) work in progress

- [Explanation on Interoperability](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/20185)
    - Under review, feedback welcome

- TODO: [Refactor development documentation?](https://numpy.org/devdocs/dev/index.html)
    - Complex and scattered. A review would be nice.
    - Add CircleCI preview instructions to developer docs

- Refactor PR template to include checklists. 

- [moving from `refguide_check.py` to pytest](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/15846#issuecomment-948051075)
    - See https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/20288

- NumPy tutorials (still pending)
    - Adding a translation policy blurb to the README of numpy-tutorials [name=Melissa]
    - [Tutorial: NumPy natural language processing from scratch with a focus on ethics](https://github.com/numpy/numpy-tutorials/pull/105)
        - Under review, CI is passing now
    - [atari-py dependency](https://github.com/numpy/numpy-tutorials/issues/87) [name=Mukulika]
        - Low priority, should be easy to fix

- [A nice idea from matplotlib: rename CircleCI job so it's easy to spot rendered docs pages](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/21423)

- Vasiliy raises that not only the developer documentation, but some other pages in the site are hard to navigate for newcomers. Concretely, the suggestion is to rename "Learn" to "Tutorials" or another label in the top link bar.

- Ross suggests creating a gallery of examples (using perhaps visualizations for thumbnails)
    - Juan mentions the [SciPy central](https://github.com/scipy/SciPyCentral)

- Ross [opened an issue at SciPy Cookbook](https://github.com/scipy/scipy-cookbook/issues/47)
    - Juan mentions https://opencomputinglab.github.io/SubjectMatterNotebooks/intro.html
    - Could be a GSoD/internship project?
    - Ross has the infrastructure set up
    - Next steps: should this be archived and updated as a new site? The current suggestion is to keep the name and update the contents.
    - Some of the content now lives in the NumPy or matplotlib docs, and can be removed/link to current pages.
    - Ross proposes cleaning up the content first and removing clearly redundant pages. 

## New document ideas: 
- Idea: [How to partition a domain using NumPy](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/19670#issuecomment-916884703), with differences between arange, linspace, ogrid and mgrid.
- [Typed NumPY API usage issue](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/19875)
- [How to find your way in the code?](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/15567)
- Tracking F2PY usage per standard, kinda like --> https://docs.lfortran.org/progress/ [name=Rohit]
