# 2021-11-22 NumPy Documentation Team meeting

- Time: 4PM UTC
- Join via Zoom at: [link](https://zoom.us/j/96219574921?pwd=VTRNeGwwOUlrYVNYSENpVVBRRjlkZz09)

**Present:** Melissa MendonÃ§a, Rohit Goswami, Vasiliy, Mukulika Pahari, Ross Barnowski, Juanita Gomez, Juan Luis Cano, Reshama Shaikh


## Topics

- GSoD updates: last meeting
    - [Case study draft](https://hackmd.io/@melissawm/HkuZuIN8K)
    - [Tutorial:Analysis of air pollution levels before and after lockdowns](https://github.com/numpy/numpy-tutorials/issues/110) work in progress

- Discuss credit and how to inform contributors about the roles they can take in the project.
    - Do we have metrics or do we want to keep this case by case?
    - Reshama mentions that scikit-learn has core developer and triage roles.

- Vasiliy mentions he intends to check for broken links and audit the developer docs for duplication and outdated content.

- [`true_divide` docstrings](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/20246): Is it a docs issue or needs a full code refactor to remove `true_divide`, for the documentation to make sense?
    - Add a `needs decision` label and bring it up at the next triage meeting.

- Landing page with sphinx-panels is in the works; we should put a milestone and make sure it lands before the next release (late December)

- Rohit mentions the need for better backports and release docs, for redundancy. He suggests shadowing Chuck for the next release so that he learns the process.

- Discussion of https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/20346#issuecomment-973163952

- Rohit mentions we could use the time from these meetings to work on docs now that GSoD is finished; Ross mentions we can take the time to review current docs, broken links or add examples to API reference docs.

## Notes from previous meetings

- [Explanation on Interoperability](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/20185)
    - Under review, feedback welcome

- TODO: [Refactor development documentation?](https://numpy.org/devdocs/dev/index.html)
    - Complex and scattered. A review would be nice.
    - Add CircleCI preview instructions to developer docs

- Refactor PR template to include checklists. 

- [moving from `refguide_check.py` to pytest](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/15846#issuecomment-948051075)
    - See https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/20288

- NumPy tutorials (still pending)
    - Adding a translation policy blurb to the README of numpy-tutorials [name=Melissa]
    - [Tutorial: NumPy natural language processing from scratch with a focus on ethics](https://github.com/numpy/numpy-tutorials/pull/105)
        - Under review, CI is passing now
    - [atari-py dependency](https://github.com/numpy/numpy-tutorials/issues/87) [name=Mukulika]
        - Low priority, should be easy to fix

- [A nice idea from matplotlib: rename CircleCI job so it's easy to spot rendered docs pages](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/21423)

- Ross [opened an issue at SciPy Cookbook](https://github.com/scipy/scipy-cookbook/issues/47)


## New document ideas: 
- Idea: [How to partition a domain using NumPy](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/19670#issuecomment-916884703), with differences between arange, linspace, ogrid and mgrid.
- [Typed NumPY API usage issue](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/19875)
- [How to find your way in the code?](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/15567)
- Tracking F2PY usage per standard, kinda like --> https://docs.lfortran.org/progress/ [name=Rohit]
