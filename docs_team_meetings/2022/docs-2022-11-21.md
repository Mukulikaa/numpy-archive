### Code of Conduct

We want to take a moment to remind you that this meeting is meant to be welcoming and inclusive. It's important for us to have a healthy community. Like all NumPy spaces, and everyone participating in them, this meeting will follow our [Code of Conduct](https://numpy.org/code-of-conduct/). If you haven't read it yet, please take some time to do so later on as it already applies to you. For now, in short, please be kind and generous towards one another. 

If you see violations, take a screenshot, intervene in a respectful manner, and report it to the CoC Committee via email. For more information, refer to the Reporting Guidelines section on https://numpy.org/code-of-conduct/.

## Follow-up from last meeting / discussions

- [name=inessa] Presentation topics for NumPy Newcomers’ Hour 
To suggest a topic for future presentations, leave a comment in this tracking issue: https://github.com/numpy/archive/issues/58.
Ross: a "show and tell" by a NumPy maintainer/experienced contributor where they work on an issue or PR in numpy/numpy in real life. Announce topics in a thread to the announcement.
Pros: – no preparation is required from a speaker, – showcasing real life scenarios of working on the NumPy code base.
Melissa: invite Evgeni to speak about refguide_check.


- [name=Inessa & Melissa] [Documentation user stories](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/22089)
    *Feel free to add yours!*

- Sebastian: refguide_check (non)failures on https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/22449
    - doctests need to be updated
    - We could take care of this automation for NumPy, and collaborate with AstroPy or some other project that uses doctest-plus.
    - Timeline: NEP 51 needs to be accepted (next two weeks, possibly). #22449 should be accepeted next. By the end of the year this should be done.
    - We can work on a solution for this but it's not urgent (not for next release)

- Inessa: issues related to the NumPy educational content:
https://github.com/numpy/numpy-newsletter/issues/20
https://github.com/numpy/numpy-newsletter/issues/24
https://github.com/numpy/numpy-newsletter/issues/25
https://github.com/numpy/numpy-newsletter/issues/26
If you’d like to work on any of them, leave a comment on GitHub (below the relevant issue).

- Inessa: NumPy Newcomers' Hour - November 17th, 2022
Speaker: Ross Barnowski
Topic: Maintaining /numpy-tutorials
Video recording has been posted on the NumPy YouTube channel: https://youtu.be/A-UCO1F09M4.

## New Topics

- Inessa: DEP: Deprecate np.round_: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/22617
    - Inessa to submit a PR, include a link to the mailing list announcement, ping Ross for review
    - Remove after 2 releases 

- Inessa: DOC: Remove info specific to Python 2 from the latest docs version: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/22635
This is a "sprintable" issue.

- Discussion around the "sprint" label.
Changing the label from "sprint" to "sprintable" to indicate that this issue isn't reserved for a sprint.

- Inessa: Triage guidelines for numpy/numpy 
Question: where in the documentation should it be placed?
Answer: Below: https://numpy.org/doc/stable/dev/reviewer_guidelines.html.
Discussion: Perhaps, we should re-organize the document hierarchy of the Contributor Guide. (Open a discussion in a separate issue or PR.)
