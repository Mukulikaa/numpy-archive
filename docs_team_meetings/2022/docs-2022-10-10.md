### Code of Conduct

We want to take a moment to remind you that this meeting is meant to be welcoming and inclusive. It's important for us to have a healthy community. Like all NumPy spaces, and everyone participating in them, this meeting will follow our [Code of Conduct](https://numpy.org/code-of-conduct/). If you haven't read it yet, please take some time to do so later on as it already applies to you. For now, in short, please be kind and generous towards one another. 

If you see violations, take a screenshot, intervene in a respectful manner, and report it to the CoC Committee via email. For more information, refer to the Reporting Guidelines section on https://numpy.org/code-of-conduct/.

**Present** *(add your name and GitHub handle)*: Melissa Mendonça (@melissawm), Inessa Pawson, Mukulika Pahari (@Mukulikaa), Pankaj Shaw

## Follow-up from last meeting / discussions
- Inessa: A video recording of the design jam session on the NumPy contributor journey map led by @Mars Lee has been posted on the NumPy YouTube channel: https://youtu.be/QhrqPr0TNrs.
    

## New Topics
- Inessa: Listing of all numpy functions that support `__array_function__`: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/15544
How could we incorporate it in the NumPy documentation?
*Decision:* reach out to Sebastian

- [DOC: Complete references to Capsules instead of CObjects #22420](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/22420)
    - https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/capsule.html
Possibly a good issue for a sprint.

- Inessa: BUG: Outstanding Python 2 code/documentation: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/22400
Would in any of the instances above we prefer to keep references to Python 2? What are your thoughts on editing references to Python 2 in the NumPy documentation and code base in general?
*Decision:* Melissa suggested to remove all the references to Python 2. The Python 2 related documentation is available in older versions and accessible via the version switcher.
Inessa will put it up for a discussion at the next commuity meeting before responding to the contributor.
