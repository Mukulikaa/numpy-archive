### Code of Conduct

We want to take a moment to remind you that this meeting is meant to be welcoming and inclusive. It's important for us to have a healthy community. Like all NumPy spaces, and everyone participating in them, this meeting will follow our [Code of Conduct](https://numpy.org/code-of-conduct/). If you haven't read it yet, please take some time to do so later on as it already applies to you. For now, in short, please be kind and generous towards one another. 

If you see violations, take a screenshot, intervene in a respectful manner, and report it to the CoC Committee via email. For more information, refer to the Reporting Guidelines section on https://numpy.org/code-of-conduct/.

**Present** *(add your name and GitHub handle)*: Melissa Mendonça (@melissawm), Kai Striega (@kai-striega), Sebastian Berg (@seberg)


## Follow-up from last meeting / discussions

- [name=inessa] Presentation topics for NumPy Newcomers’ Hour 
To suggest a topic for future presentations, leave a comment in this tracking issue: https://github.com/numpy/archive/issues/58.

- [name=Inessa & Melissa] [Documentation user stories](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/22089)
    *Feel free to add yours!*

- Inessa: BUG: Outstanding Python 2 code/documentation: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/22400
Question: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/22400#issuecomment-1277302874
    - Possible remaining issues could be used in a newcomers sprint 


- Sebastian: [Melissa's tutorial](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/22375) should be merged.

- Sebastian: refguide_check (non)failures on https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/22449
    - doctests might need to be updated
    - CircleCI build failing, looks like running on rst and not docstring
    - Might be a good idea to put together a downstream guide (or automation if possible) with NEP51 for the reasoning and a workflow of how to update all the doctests.
    - We could take care of this automation for NumPy, and collaborate with AstroPy or some other project that uses doctest-plus.
    - Timeline: NEP 51 needs to be accepted (next two weeks, possibly). #22449 should be accepeted next. By the end of the year this should be done.

- Sebastian: Zones of contribution project
    - Updated it, will try populating it for the next few weeks. 

## New Topics
- Inessa: issues related to the NumPy educational content:

If you’d like to work on any of them, leave a comment on GitHub (below the relevant issue).

- Inessa: NumPy Newcomers' Hour - November 17th, 2022, 8 pm UTC
Speaker: Ross Barnowski
Topic: Maintaining /numpy-tutorials

- Kai: Updating numpy-financial's docs to the new theme
    - Will ping folks on scientific python discord
    - Also needs a light content update (mentioning it's not a part of NumPy anymore, it's in maintenance mode and not accepting new features anymore)
