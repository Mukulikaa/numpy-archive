## Topics

- Data Umbrella LatAm/Africa sprint 2022
  - Important dates:
	- Saturday, June 18, 2022:  Pre-sprint session (1 hour) 
	- Saturday, June 25, 2022:  Day of Sprint (4 hours)
	- Saturday, July 9, 2022:  Post-sprint follow-up (1 hour)
  - Call for contributions: 
	- In preparation for the sprint, we will need help with mainly administrative tasks, e.g., answering questions on Discord before and after the sprint, surveys, social media, and more. Spanish, Portuguese, and French speakers, we especially need you here! 
	The work begins in late April 2022. Contact Inessa (via email or Slack) if you would like to help.
    - List of possible issues (probably needs a refresh): https://hackmd.io/9pfJGVlVSVKKOQgCFsjqLQ 
    - Consider choosing certain PRs which can be reverted on a fork and reworked through for sprints / newcomers meet etc.
        - Pro: Would also allow an exploration of the CI and other things
        - Con: Needs the PR author / reviewer to be present --> more labor intensive
- Link checker
    - Recap :: We would like to run this on the CI, for generated HTML; possibly also on the docstrings --> run `make linkcheck` in the CI
    - Possibly consider running on a schedule to reduce load (GHA allows this) 
    - What should be done with the results? -> create a tracking issue

- Can we re-take https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/17851?
    - could be useful maybe https://rgoswami.me/snippets/docker-dev-envs/ 
        - Slightly less embarassing `docker` usage here: https://rgoswami.me/posts/tinyssh-dockerdev-env/
    - doesn't have to follow the exact same format or content, but the idea is nice
- Should be closed? https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/10647 (done)

- Quick PR review request =) https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/20948
- NumPy tutorials landing page layout: https://github.com/numpy/numpy-tutorials/pull/123
    - Preview: https://416-248354526-gh.circle-artifacts.com/0/site/_build/html/index.html
      - A few extra steps are needed for contributors to add content, but they should be fairly simple if they are fully documented.
      - Tags: we could generate pages based on metadata
      - Image aspect ratios: Since these are auto-generated, it might take a little more effort to figure out
          - Consider just taking a large image and using [CSS tricks](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/aspect-ratio), https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout 
      - We could also standardize the text alignment/row placement (see for example https://github.com/numpy/numpy.org/pull/432)

- numpydoc new release: you can now do [validation for docstrings](https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/validation.html#docstring-validation-during-sphinx-build)
    - This could be useful to detect errors, but also to detect docstrings with no example section, for example. This can be useful for sprints and newcomers. Make sure to mention you don't need to activate or fix __all__ warnings.
    - We should probably link to the numpydoc docstring standard in our docs contributing guide.

- Newsletter: by the next docs meeting (Feb 14) we should have an outline for the first issue and other contributors who are interested.
    - Ideas for content are welcome and should be added in https://github.com/numpy/numpy-newsletter

# Follow-up

- We have a lot of open docs PRs. If we have some that are straightforward, feel free to comment tagging a maintainer and we can get it merged
