### Code of Conduct

We want to take a moment to remind you that this meeting is meant to be welcoming and inclusive. It's important for us to have a healthy community. Like all NumPy spaces, and everyone participating in them, this meeting will follow our [Code of Conduct](https://numpy.org/code-of-conduct/). If you haven't read it yet, please take some time to do so later on as it already applies to you. For now, in short, please be kind and generous towards one another. 

If you see violations, take a screenshot, intervene in a respectful manner, and report it to the CoC Committee via email. For more information, refer to the Reporting Guidelines section on https://numpy.org/code-of-conduct/.

**Present** *(add your name and GitHub handle)*: Mukulika (@Mukulikaa), Inessa Pawson


## Follow-up from last meeting / discussions

- [name=inessa] Presentation topics for NumPy Newcomers’ Hour 
To suggest a topic for future presentations, leave a comment in this tracking issue: https://github.com/numpy/archive/issues/58.

- [name=Inessa & Melissa] [Documentation user stories](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/22089)
    *Feel free to add yours!*

- Sebastian: refguide_check (non)failures on https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/22449
    - doctests need to be updated
    - We could take care of this automation for NumPy, and collaborate with AstroPy or some other project that uses doctest-plus.
    - Timeline: NEP 51 needs to be accepted (next two weeks, possibly). #22449 should be accepeted next. By the end of the year this should be done.
    - We can work on a solution for this but it's not urgent (not for next release)

- Inessa: issues related to the NumPy educational content:
https://github.com/numpy/numpy-newsletter/issues/20
https://github.com/numpy/numpy-newsletter/issues/24
https://github.com/numpy/numpy-newsletter/issues/25
https://github.com/numpy/numpy-newsletter/issues/26
If you’d like to work on any of them, leave a comment on GitHub (below the relevant issue).

- [name=Mukulika] Mentioning the Gitpod build option might not be appropriate for [Building from source](https://numpy.org/devdocs/user/building.html#building-from-source) 
    - It should belong to [Setting up and using your development environment](https://numpy.org/devdocs/dev/development_environment.html) instead along with the new gh-codespaces doc.
    - Add a note for users and developers

- [name=Kai] Working on https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/15571

- [name=Mukulika] Restructuring git basics docs
    - Lead to github docs instead
    - Context: gitwash is outdated and a lot of the information there can probably be removed to reduce maintenance burden

- Mathematical review of PR: [A mistake in the description of numpy.random.pareto](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/22701)
    - Melissa can review
    - Melissa has reviewed it and the issue has been taken up 

## New Topics
- NumPy 1.24.0 is now available.
The release continues the ongoing work to improve the handling and promotion of dtypes, increase execution speed, and clarify the documentation. There are a large number of new and expired deprecations due to changes in dtype promotion and cleanups.
The supported Python versions are 3.8-3.11.
A total of 184 people contributed to this release, including 107 of them contributed for the first time.
