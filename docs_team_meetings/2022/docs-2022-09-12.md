## Notes for September 12, 2022

**Present:** Melissa Mendonça (@melissawm), Inessa Pawson, Mars Lee (@marsbarlee), Sebastian Berg, Ryan Cooper, Matthew Murray

- Mars: Rough 1st draft of 'NumPy Contributor Adventure'
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/EG3Z4BR.png)
    - Here’s a sketch I made of the discussion of contributor → maintainer, from the NumPy community call on August 31, 2022.
    - Here are meeting notes [on this conversation, in the NumPy Github repo](https://github.com/numpy/archive/blob/main/community_meetings/community-2022-08-31.md#new-topics).
    - I wrote the script. I tried to address some concerns I’ve heard about illustrating or codifying an informally defined path.
        - That’s you can’t skip ahead, it’s moderated but also very community-focused. Parts such as “with mentorship”, “not a quick or easy path, but one worth having” and “community will be there with you every step of the way”
    - Also [discussed in Open Source Design forum, got input from designers](https://discourse.opensourcedesign.net/t/open-source-comics-resources-collaboration-and-funding-for-making-comics-for-open-source-projects/3130/4)
    - Questions to call attendees
        - Tone
            - Light hearted
        - Accuracy
            - Can shift, but this journey is not formalized anywhere
        - Where in the world/documentation/internet could something like this exist?
            - A Contributor Experience handbook? Not just for NumPy?
        - Expanding on and future possibilities
        - Sharing illustration on Github
            - Write image description, people can comment on as Github suggestion
                - "A person holding up a sword"
                - Github suggestion higlighting this "A person holding a magic wand"
            - Similar process to existing design feedback process, but instead of linking out to external site and requiring account like [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/7cVUnr5f4EG6yCRn2GJVQX/Untitled?node-id=0%3A1)

            - Async vs sync process
    - Discussion notes
        - Melissa likes lighter tone for inviting community
            - Understand concern of codifying informally defined process, can be refined, not too rigid. Depends if we want to make specific for NumPy or include other projects and their workflows
                - Here, you need to ask for commit rights or fulfill minimum listed in project documentation eg 5 PRs
                - "Getting to Know": tag projects
            - Covers code tracks, doesn't cover non-code
                - eg contributor experience lead, design, social media, add extra branches
                - Maybe zoom out diagram before zooming in
            - Other possible roles
                - Steering council, Maintainer, Active contributor, Drive-by contributor, Experienced user, New user
        - Having both specific and broad versions
            - Scope out, refine NumPy version first
            - Generalize later
        - Inviting people for design feedback process
            - Melissa: Concerned that this puts more workload on designer to explain images
            - Is there a way share weight of work?
            - Granularity of image description
            - Puts depth of design process, educational
        - Inessa, have experience reviewing design work, can comment
            - Worth trying, current tools are all imperfect eg Online Adobe PDF review
            - SVGs are easier to version control
                - SVGs are mathematical formula, change code from 2 pixel width to 4 pixel width, hex code #ABC123 to hex code #ABC129
                - But Github doesn't show SVGs in Github comments or Github-flavored markdown previews
        - Ryan
            - Also struggled to track changes in curriculum, diagrams
            - [Github for Poets video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCQHnlnPusY), designers using Github tracking of plain text
        - Broader discussion
            - Tracking non-plain text changes
            - Assimilationist approach: outsider takes on insider culture vs keeping distinct
                - designer taking additional responsibilities on developer workflows, platforms, Git and Github vs linking to Figma, designer workflow and platforms
            - Accomdating images on text platform: hitting storage limits since images are bigger than plain text, comparing differences
        - Next actions
            - [ ] Mars: A draft PR, on Mars fork, on numpy.org repo
            - Not final submission place, but to start this design process experiment
            - Could go under https://numpy.org/contribute/
