## Topics

- Testing guidelines feedback (Inessa)
    - Could we include a short tutorial, video or guide on testing procedures?
- [DOC/ENH: Tutorial for adding C functions #20733](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/20733)
- Newsletter (Inessa)
    - Lev suggests "Comprehensive guide to dtypes" could be a topic for the newsletter
    - Ideas for content are welcome and should be added in https://github.com/numpy/numpy-newsletter
    - We need 1 or 2 technical writers to help with content for the newsletter
- Survey (Inessa/Mars)
    - Visual Report Preview: [Community section, page 1](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oSAhguzinC-zqVYFgDH7iAbHR4uf6fjF/view?usp=sharing)
    - Creating documention of visual report making process and tools
        - Welcoming for future graphic designers. Creating space and tasks that explicitly invite non-code contributions
- "How to find yourself in the code" (Melissa)
    - Panel with Sebastian and Matti (maybe more) about how to find yourself in the code, with people/newcomers asking questions
        - Maybe like a gameshow, fastest expert to get on the right page gets points!
        - Shows how difficult or easy it is, revealing the weak points of documentation in a fun, interactive way
        - 'What is the purpose of the `fill_value` in masked arrays?' (Lev)
- [the pydata theme](https://github.com/pydata/pydata-sphinx-theme/releases/tag/v0.8.0) has a new release, and one of the older releases added a version dropdown. You can see it in action in [their documentation](https://pydata-sphinx-theme.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) One issue: if we add the version selector on one version, what happens when you move to a previous version without it, how do you get back? (mattip)
    - The next pydata-sphinx-theme will have a versioning dropdown for docs. We should start thinking of maybe fixing our docs folder structure and make it simpler if the versioning allows it.
    - devdocs should be moved to a more normal place
    - Matti will open an issue

- We have a lot of open docs PRs. If we have some that are straightforward, feel free to comment tagging a maintainer and we can get it merged

- [Analysis of air pollution levels before and after lockdown](https://github.com/numpy/numpy-tutorials/pull/111) tutorial ready for review.
