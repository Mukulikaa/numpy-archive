## Notes for July 4th, 2022

**Present:** Melissa Mendonça (@melissawm), Angélica Cardozo, Meekail Zain (@micky774), Inessa Pawson (@inessapawson), Sebastian Berg


- DOC: Typed NumPY API usage: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/19875#issuecomment-1171221657
Feedback is welcome.

- [Quotes ("Mottos") in documentation](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/21858)
Feedback is welcome (post directly on GitHub)

- DOC: write a how-to guide about using stack/hstack/vstack/concatenate: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/21916
    - There are other groups of functions in the documentation that could use how-tos as well. Feel free to open issues requesting this kind of content!

- Shout out to Benny and Angelica for working on transcripts and timestamps of the NumPy videos.
  - Melissa is available to review the transcript in Portuguese.
  - Having more help with video trascripts would be great. Possible solution: make a call for contributions to the channel subscribers.

- [NumPy wiki](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/wiki/)
    - [Proposal](https://hackmd.io/@melissawm/r1ZhQves5)
    - Feedback at the meeting: good idea.
- DOC: Add a request for explaining the significance of an issue to the issue templates: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/21919
    - Good idea
    - Templates to be modified: a bug report and a feature request.
    - [x] Inessa will make the changes.

- Discussion: how to improve the mid-level/intermediate guidance or documentation for contributors?
    - Where can people do "meaningful" contributions?
    - Perhaps video tutorials for how to add a mock method/ufunc/... as a means to introduce audience to machinary surrounding a topic (e.g. how are array methods hooked up, how are modules built/generated, etc.)
    - Organize documentation with "zones of contribution" (related to contributor journey maps and profiles)
        - Example zones (just a rough idea): python (internal testing), python (user-facing/API), C (Python C-API), C (ufuncs/backend)
    - Improve component labels
