## Notes for the June 6, 2022 meeting

**Present:** Melissa Mendonça (@melissawm), Matti Picus (@mattip), Ryan Cooper (@cooperrc), Mars Lee (@marsbarlee), Rohit Goswami (@haozeke), Sebastian Berg (@seberg)

- Melissa: [Sphinx design migration plans](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/23169)
    - Replacement for sphinx-panels
    - Need less CSS customization- comes with lots of stuff so could clean up own code
    - No need to act now
    - [Migration guide](https://sphinx-design.readthedocs.io/en/latest/get_started.html#migrating-from-sphinx-panels)

- Inessa: NumPy Newcomers’ Hour – June 2nd, 2022 at 4 pm UTC
Speaker: Sebastian Berg
Topic: Maintaining NumPy: Deprecations
Video recording is now available on the NumPy YouTube channel: https://youtu.be/DjiC4-8c5f0
(Remember to subscribe!)
    - Call for contributions: Create a transcript of the video to be added to the posted YT video and as a separate document for future NumPy documentation (e.g., as a foundation for a how-to guide).
        - Base off Youtube auto-captions --> `.vtt` and then edit
        - Hopefully just minor corrections, such as technical terms
        - Can also add Youtube Timestamps. Helps people find important parts, like headers in documentation
    - Where to keep transcripts?
        - Archive in https://github.com/numpy/archive?
        - [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com/) (Large File Storage)?
        - Dropbox?
        - Self-host? --> Resilio Sync has P2P stuff which is free (as long as one of us keeps it on one PC)
        - Ask other projects if they have unified hosting solution?
            - Melissa ask NumFOCUS

- Bhavuk Kalra: Should we close these PR's or Keep it around for further discussion - 1)  [Revert PR for breathe](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/21270) (Made just in case, If something didn't worked out). 2) [Update Gitpod FAQ](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/21263)
    - Matti to close this

- Bhavuk Kalra: Mathematical formulae rendering is slow, getting tracked in this issue - [MathJAX rendering is slow](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/21419), suggestions on the test done?

- Bhavuk Kalra: Open for suggestions for a rought draft: [Script for finding and editing the Doc Strings](https://hackmd.io/Uv7TotDjRRKa3iuwf_PpCw)
    - Melissa has written something similar: [How to add examples to NumPy docstrings ](https://hackmd.io/@melissawm/Sy1SGhvD9)
    - Melissa and Bhavuk to submit a (joint?) PR

- Rohit: Which parts of NumPy break SciPy? Should we have a doc explaining that?
    - e.g. F2PY / maybe Sebastian's changes to dtypes sometimes

- Version switcher merged in numpy/doc

- Melissa: Any opinions or suggestions on [scipy: Examples missing import numpy as np?](https://github.com/scipy/scipy/issues/13049)
    - Not directly about us but interesting
    - "if we have 'import matplotlib as mpl' then why don't we have import numpy as np?"

- Melissa: Relevance and role of NumPy wiki
    - Currently only visible: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/wiki/_history
    - Wiki mostly used to point at Season of Docs, Summer of Code
    - Problems
        - Obscure
        - Some people not getting notifications
        - Edit rights and rogue edits
        - Github edit right options too broad- would like more granular control
        - Security: spam, marketing, switching links
    - Solution
        - Lock it and require wiki changes to be PRs?
        - Review wiki, see what to keep or move (eg move old meeting notes, archive) and think of new workflow
        - Open seasonally such as for Season of Docs and let wiki be forum/bulletin board for casual conversation
        - Melissa will open tracking issue with wiki docs to be moved/deleted
