### Code of Conduct

We want to take a moment to remind you that this meeting is meant to be welcoming and inclusive. It's important for us to have a healthy community. Like all NumPy spaces, and everyone participating in them, this meeting will follow our [Code of Conduct](https://numpy.org/code-of-conduct/). If you haven't read it yet, please take some time to do so later on as it already applies to you. For now, in short, please be kind and generous towards one another. 

If you see violations, take a screenshot, intervene in a respectful manner, and report it to the CoC Committee via email. For more information, refer to the Reporting Guidelines section on https://numpy.org/code-of-conduct/.

## Follow-up from last meeting / discussions

- [name=inessa] Presentation topics for NumPy Newcomers’ Hour 
To suggest a topic for future presentations, leave a comment in this tracking issue: https://github.com/numpy/archive/issues/58.

- [name=Inessa & Melissa] [Documentation user stories](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/22089)
    *Feel free to add yours!*

- Sebastian: refguide_check (non)failures on https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/22449
    - doctests need to be updated
    - We could take care of this automation for NumPy, and collaborate with AstroPy or some other project that uses doctest-plus.
    - Timeline: NEP 51 needs to be accepted (next two weeks, possibly). #22449 should be accepeted next. By the end of the year this should be done.
    - We can work on a solution for this but it's not urgent (not for next release)

- Inessa: issues related to the NumPy educational content:
https://github.com/numpy/numpy-newsletter/issues/20
https://github.com/numpy/numpy-newsletter/issues/24
https://github.com/numpy/numpy-newsletter/issues/25
https://github.com/numpy/numpy-newsletter/issues/26
If you’d like to work on any of them, leave a comment on GitHub (below the relevant issue).



## New Topics

- [name=Angélica] https://github.com/numpy/archive/pulls

- [name=Mukulika] Mentioning the Gitpod build option might not be appropriate for [Building from source](https://numpy.org/devdocs/user/building.html#building-from-source) 
    - It should belong to [Setting up and using your development environment](https://numpy.org/devdocs/dev/development_environment.html) instead along with the new gh-codespaces doc.
    - Add a note for users and developers

- [name=Melissa] Doc PR reviews: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/labels/04%20-%20Documentation

- [name=Kai] Working on https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/15571

- [name=Mukulika] Restructuring git basics docs
    - Lead to github docs instead
    - Context: gitwash is outdated and a lot of the information there can probably be removed to reduce maintenance burden

- Rebuilding problems from NumPy weekend sprint
    - Sphinx not detecting change- perhaps due to Sphinx caching?
    - gitclean seems to fix it
    - Next time: call someone in?

- Open call to action: help review open PRs
    - Can leave comments and then ping maintainers
    - Can also ping maintainers if your own PR is still open

- Mathematical review of PR: [A mistake in the description of numpy.random.pareto](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/22701)
    - Melissa can review

- Recap of the PyData Global'22 newcomers sprint
    - 9 people in total.
    See the list of the sprint participants here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1t9uzJf7td93yZBnTPn3VeCKxl9fg-C4Fk-FJR5AMEHY/edit?usp=sharing
    - Problems: mostly with building locally
    - Otherwise, went smoothly
    - Getting used to workflow of fetching tags 
        - consequence of version-control
        - Ganesh has a PR for that - https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/22732
