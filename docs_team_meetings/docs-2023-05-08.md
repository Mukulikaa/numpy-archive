### Code of Conduct

We want to take a moment to remind you that this meeting is meant to be welcoming and inclusive. It's important for us to have a healthy community. Like all NumPy spaces, and everyone participating in them, this meeting will follow our [Code of Conduct](https://numpy.org/code-of-conduct/). If you haven't read it yet, please take some time to do so later on as it already applies to you. For now, in short, please be kind and generous towards one another. 

If you see violations, take a screenshot, intervene in a respectful manner, and report it to the CoC Committee via email. For more information, refer to the Reporting Guidelines section on https://numpy.org/code-of-conduct/.

**Present:** Mukulika, Ross, Jules, Mridul, Mars, Inessa

## Follow-up from last meeting / discussions

- [name=rossbar] Dealing with data for NumPy tutorials
  * **Action item**: Start with scikit-learn data
  * Future SPEC? How to host data since every project is doing it's own thing
  * Core problem: No free infrastructure for data like there is for source code


- Add to new document ideas:
    - Understanding NumPy striding while doing a transpose
        - We can use the xray dataset for the illustration
    - Best practices for random number generators for parallelization
        - Monte Carlo estimation for pi - possible example
    - A guide for common performance issue questions
        - Could be a Sphinx gallery for better discoverabilty

    - Speak to Pamphile about adding educational materials based on his recent academic papers:
      - https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.05309
      - https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.13470
     
    - As a general pattern: be aware that scipy often has improved interfaces to things that are computed "by-hand" in numpy

- [mattip] What is up with Sphinx 6? There is an open issue around the need to pin to sphinx 5, and breathe also requires sphinx5. In order to prove it is working, we need to actually deploy the docs which means merging the change to `main`, so we would have to do a controlled experiment on the devdocs deployment.
  * Related to the above: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/23677


  * Also, sphinx 7 is out: :scream: 
  * Open up as contribution opportunity- testing with Sphinx 7


## New Topics

- Gathering community input for GSOD-NumPy 2023 with a 10 minute Brainstorming Session
    - [Link to Google Jamboard](https://jamboard.google.com/d/1j_rEIslOh59N9cLGU1VGc7rTc88SuLTi7l4YqTqAULc/edit?usp=sharing)
    - Main questions
        - What comments or concerns do you have about this project?
        - Based on your role in NumPy, what would your fantasy class be?
    - Can leave your comments on Jamboard after meeting as well
    - Discussion points
        - Incomplete metaphor: How well does the fantasy RPG model match the contribution model?
        - In fantasy RPG, role -> experience. In contribution, gain experience -> maybe gain role
        - Move to Role-based -> Experience based. Use badges or tags instead of RPG class?
        - Inherent difficulty in quantifying what cannot be easily quantified
        - Concern: Quantifying without nuance might turn contribution into a competition
        - Hesitation to call code contributor warriors. Maybe fits in RPG context but not in building software?
        - Is there another metaphor that could work? eg building houses? camping?
        - Dungeons and Dragons (DnD) was given as a metaphor. But DnD is very western-centric, may be unfamiliar to some audiences
