### Code of Conduct

We want to take a moment to remind you that this meeting is meant to be welcoming and inclusive. It's important for us to have a healthy community. Like all NumPy spaces, and everyone participating in them, this meeting will follow our [Code of Conduct](https://numpy.org/code-of-conduct/). If you haven't read it yet, please take some time to do so later on as it already applies to you. For now, in short, please be kind and generous towards one another. 

If you see violations, take a screenshot, intervene in a respectful manner, and report it to the CoC Committee via email. For more information, refer to the Reporting Guidelines section on https://numpy.org/code-of-conduct/.

**Present:** Mukulika, Jules, Inessa

## Follow-up from last meeting / discussions

- [name=rossbar] Dealing with data for NumPy tutorials
  * **Action item**: Start with scikit-learn data
  * Future SPEC? How to host data since every project is doing it's own thing
  * Core problem: No free infrastructure for data like there is for source code


- Add to new document ideas:
    - Understanding NumPy striding while doing a transpose
        - We can use the xray dataset for the illustration
    - Best practices for random number generators for parallelization
        - Monte Carlo estimation for pi - possible example
    - A guide for common performance issue questions
        - Could be a Sphinx gallery for better discoverabilty

    - Speak to Pamphile about adding educational materials based on his recent academic papers:
      - https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.05309
      - https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.13470
     
    - As a general pattern: be aware that scipy often has improved interfaces to things that are computed "by-hand" in numpy

- [mattip] What is up with Sphinx 6? There is an open issue around the need to pin to sphinx 5, and breathe also requires sphinx5. In order to prove it is working, we need to actually deploy the docs which means merging the change to `main`, so we would have to do a controlled experiment on the devdocs deployment.
  * Related to the above: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/23677


  * Also, sphinx 7 is out: :scream: 
  * Open up as contribution opportunity- testing with Sphinx 7

- Now at Outlining stage for GSOD-NumPy 2023 (May 15-26)
    - Completed Gathering community input stage and 3 brainstorming sesions
        - At Newcomer(May 4) NumPy Docs (May 8), Commmunity (May 10)
        - [Link to Google Jamboard](https://jamboard.google.com/d/1j_rEIslOh59N9cLGU1VGc7rTc88SuLTi7l4YqTqAULc/edit?usp=sharing)
    - [Summary from Brainstorming Sessions](https://github.com/MarsBarLee/gsod-numpy-2023/blob/main/outlining/summary-from-brainstorming-sessions.md)
    - Next steps
        - Narrow down [User Personas](https://github.com/MarsBarLee/gsod-numpy-2023/blob/main/outlining/user-persona-contributor-pathways.md)
        - Draw [Concept Art Prompts](https://github.com/MarsBarLee/gsod-numpy-2023/blob/main/outlining/concept-art.md)
    - Discussion points
        - Use of metaphor: to make a complicated topic friendly
        - Metaphor should not core topic (contributor workflow) make more complicated
        - User Persona: Could get input eg Twitter
            - Getting more user input would be best practice: but may not fit in timeline
            - Could do later, perhaps future review stage
    - Review stage
        - on NumPy github issues through mailing list, slack and community meeting channels.
        - Using Google Docs, since easier to comment on images than on Github PR
        - Reviews stage open for 2 weeks (late May-early June)
    - Letting go making full 'comic book style'
        - Due to time constraints, may not be able to make full flowing story panel to panel
        - May end up with blog style: informational images with text underneath to explain in more detail
        - Similar to [prototype](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:720/format:webp/1*kwkvHzegb0z4TzeHsuF_GQ.png)
        - Less similar to [SciPy comics](https://heyzine.com/flip-book/f3c7f85cdc.html)
        - Especially since contributor workflow has several different scopes
            - Zoomed in scope, eg people working together during a sprint
            - Zoomed out scope, eg role of maintainers or community members  
            - Several different characters: contributor workflow would probably need at least... 6 characters? Hard to sustain coherent script for 6 characters
        - Letting go of artist ego to fully utilize 'comic book' medium
        - Need to realistically rescope to fit in other important factors eg gathering community input, representing a relatively complex topic (contributor workflow)
        - Working more as a documentary movie rather than cinematic story-driven movie
            - The value is more in documenting processes and people rather than thrilling story or camera angles
    - Recognizing desire for print version is contributor factor to wanting a 'full comic experience'
        - Paper version needs to fit rectangular size, hence use of panels
        - Digital version can be any size, but we can keep to rectangular size
        - Digital version reach wider audience, especially outside conferences in North America
    

## New Topics

- https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/23547 - review required.

- https://github.com/numpy/doc/pull/15 - close?

- Jules: Adding timestamps to YoutTube video:
    - Broad chapters instead of minute-by-minute timestamps
    - Submit a markdown PR to the newsletter repo
    - Someone approves and submits to YouTube (needs access)
    - An example of how to submit a PR with the timestamps: https://github.com/numpy/numpy-newsletter/pull/22/files
