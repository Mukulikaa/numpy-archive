### Code of Conduct

We want to take a moment to remind you that this meeting is meant to be welcoming and inclusive. It's important for us to have a healthy community. Like all NumPy spaces, and everyone participating in them, this meeting will follow our [Code of Conduct](https://numpy.org/code-of-conduct/). If you haven't read it yet, please take some time to do so later on as it already applies to you. For now, in short, please be kind and generous towards one another. 

If you see violations, take a screenshot, intervene in a respectful manner, and report it to the CoC Committee via email. For more information, refer to the Reporting Guidelines section on https://numpy.org/code-of-conduct/.

## Follow-up from last meeting / discussions



## New Topics

    
- **Review #2** for GSOD-NumPy 2023
    - [Link to Script](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fjLTDqSkcKMxo8oSTRThllBFpjo5rXS9/edit?rtpof=true&sd=true)
    - Script focuses on a group of students learning how to contribute to NumPy by creating an issue for a usability problem
    - Hosting a review session at the **next NumPy Community Meeting on August 16**
    - [Github thread](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/24382) and Google Docs will be open for the next two weeks and **close on August 23**
    - Questions from previous drafts 
        - What science class are these grad students taking in this story? -> Microbiology
        - Should the class they're taking be based on a previous class Ross taught? NE 204 - [Advanced Concepts in Radiation Detection and Measurement](https://ne204-fall2018.github.io/pages/course-overview.html) -> Yes, but script does not go into detail, more general focus on 'live cell imagery'
        - Do these images linked in this thread explain live cell imagery correctly? -> Made an attempt on [page 2](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fjLTDqSkcKMxo8oSTRThllBFpjo5rXS9/edit#bookmark=id.1fob9te)
        - Are the students operating narray for image processing of the cell images?
            - Made an attempt on [page 2](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fjLTDqSkcKMxo8oSTRThllBFpjo5rXS9/edit#bookmark=id.1fob9te)
            - Resource I referenced: https://note.nkmk.me/en/python-numpy-image-processing/
        - Do all students have the npz file a dataset they downloaded for the class? Or does each student have their own npz file, from their microscope/lab? -> In script, each student's work is bundled together, making it hard to know whose cells are whose
    - Some specific parts I would like feedback on:
        - **Themes**
          - [On Page 5, ](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fjLTDqSkcKMxo8oSTRThllBFpjo5rXS9/edit?disco=AAAA3sVZK9Y)does this panel accurately show the tie between open source and open science?
        - **Story and Pacing**
          - Does this seem like a reasonable amount of content to cover in 16 pages?
          - Do the three students interacting together feel realistic?
            - eg Since they're beginners, they don't at answer immediately
            - eg not too mean-spirited? They argue, to show different approaches
        - **Accuracy**
          - [On Page 3](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fjLTDqSkcKMxo8oSTRThllBFpjo5rXS9/edit?disco=AAAA3sVZK9c), how accurate is the .npz code?
          - [On Page 7](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fjLTDqSkcKMxo8oSTRThllBFpjo5rXS9/edit?disco=AAAA3sVZK9k), does the visual metaphor of the NumPy issue tracker as a bulletin board make sense?
      - Comments and Next Actions from today's Docs call
          - Pacing, Summary of Microbiology and Open Scienece looks good
          - Mars to follow-up with Mukulika
              - on getting full printout of npz to better represent npz 
              - visual representation of narray and image processing

    - **Previous steps**:
        - Review #1 (July)
        - Outlining stage for GSOD-NumPy 2023 (May 15-26):
        - Gathering community input stage and 3 brainstorming sesions
            - At Newcomer(May 4) NumPy Docs (May 8), Commmunity (May 10)
            - [Link to Google Jamboard](https://jamboard.google.com/d/1j_rEIslOh59N9cLGU1VGc7rTc88SuLTi7l4YqTqAULc/edit?usp=sharing)
