## Follow-up from last meeting / discussions

- [Draft NEP 54](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/24138/files) and [technical discussion](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/24084) is still not settled enough.
- For https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/24385 (static dispatch PR): Ralf to post a benchmark question; let's try to get this PR to be realistic representation of what the end result would look like. 
- Sayed provided a list of missing intrinsics in the proposed NEP 54.

## New topics

- float16/bfloat16: should we have better support, e.g. as an external package providing bfloat16
  Raghuveer: not a short-term focus. Jan: bf16 quite useful for ML.
- SVML: Sayed started adding C code for 1ULP in a [PR to SVML](https://github.com/numpy/SVML/pull/5/files). Will continue to work on this and other functions.
- Raghuveer: prefer batch interface instead of returning single reg like SVML, because overhead at least for fp16 was high: compiler reloads tables inside the function, which is called multiple times from the batch loop. numpy is anyway going to process the entire batch.
- NEP 54: wait until all Highway ops added? No, better to plan ahead. There is a problem with the `_SIMD` module: it will be difficult to test the single Highway intrinsics without namespaces.
- Sayed: want to pass -mno-mmx flag, was necessary for compiler. Jan: OK to add such a flag.
- Jan: TODO is to add Unpredictable1 to add to Highway tests so compiler doesn't 'optimize out' test code
- https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/24018 - VQSort. should change to static dispatch. Highest priority, start with this first before thinking about other math/SIMD code.

## Action items
- Raghuveer: ask again to open-source SVML. Show PR#5 : going to happen anyway.
