**Code of Conduct**
The NumPy Steering Council has made a strong commitment to creating an open, inclusive, and positive community. 
All attendees of NumPy community events must adhere to the NumPy Code of Conduct (https://numpy.org/code-of-conduct/). 
If you see violations, take a screenshot, intervene in a respectful manner, and report it to the CoC Committee via email. For more information, refer to the Reporting Guidelines section on https://numpy.org/code-of-conduct/.


**Present**: Sayed Adel, Ralf Gommers, Chris Sidebottom, Raghuveer Devulapalli, Sebastian Berg, Jan Wassenberg


## Follow-up from last meeting / discussions

- Michael Siebert: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/23752. Discuss with seberg in review comments, maybe attend triage meeting where he might be present, or continue via review functions. Sayed thinks the approach is reasonable and will review.
    - Chris: Still needs a review? (Happy to pick it up, it's in the BLAS sort of space)
        - Sayed: Will review and leave comments
    - Sayed: Custom allocation used in malloc, are we ok with this?
        - Should use PyMem..Alloc? PyArray..Alloc?

## New topics

- Awaiting Highway release to fix (https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/25464)
    - Chris: Release v1.1.0 incoming (https://github.com/google/highway/pull/1982)
    - Sayed: We can add an option for disabling Highway for current wheel builds
    - Ralf: No need to do anything now, wait for Highway release, disable at the last moment if Highway release isn't done in time and we need to build wheels for 2.0.0rc1. (we already have a `-Ddisable-highway` build flag)

- Highway trial for sin/cos f32 (https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/25781), performance hasn't hit parity and there are some weird errors.
    - Chris: Looks like Gather/Scatter are pretty poor on ASIMD, can we blend the numpy intrinsics for that right now and then port them into Highway? (Chris can then add a better Gather to Highway later)
    - Sayed: Performance regression likely comes from mask_bits and fallback section (ref: hwy::StoreMaskBits). Second is marking Vec as const to prevent copy from memory. 
    - Sayed: Should we set the -DHWY_HAVE_AVX2 etc flags in Meson?
    - Sayed: Need to feed information to the NumPy config/runtime tracer which needs to read Highway flags.
        - Chris: Read flags in https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/24384/files#diff-3dab9f6b607d7f02e65e7ec0ca00b6512050ef6ae9dd33b793a5036f4b3e7cb6
    - Raghuveer: Issues with lining up Highway with compiler flags like `-mavx2`, Highway expects the exact flags `-march=haswell -maes` 
        - Sayed: How do we ask Highway to raise an error if no optimisation made?
        - Jan: useful are: `HWY_TARGET` / `HWY_BASELINE_TARGETS`. And a recently added function: `DispatchedTarget`.
        - Also be aware that there's also `HWY_BROKEN_TARGETS`, which disables targets.


- C++ bindings for umath (https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/19753) needs a rebase and review regardless of Highway / not Highway
    - Chris: Happy to review once rebased, no issues with anything thusfar
    - Sayed: Should not change the external API so should be fine


- Leveraging more of Highway's pre-built functions
    - Dot / Matvec for none-f32/f64?



## Action items
- Issue for testing unit for Highway to be able to develop kernels in Python. Raise issue in Highway to discuss. Short-term: can only implement the ops required by numpy, also allows prototyping numpy kernels. Mid-term goal could be to replace existing Highway tests. To be confirmed with other users: would it be OK to depend upon python?
- Sayed to rebase https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/19753 and ping Sebastian again


## Backlog
* [PRs and issues labelled with "SIMD"](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/labels/component%3A%20SIMD) (please add)

- float16/bfloat16: should we have better support, e.g. as an external package providing bfloat16
  Raghuveer: not a short-term focus. Jan: bf16 quite useful for ML.

- Intrinsics: Highway or C++ universal intrinsics?
    - discussion, some circling back to ground we covered before / in NEP 54
    - opinions:
        - Sayed prefers universal intrinsics in C++
        - Chris has some preference for Highway, worries about longer-term maintenance
            - Discussion did show that we should be good on SVE support (open PR for that already, which should work together with the testing module)
        - Raghuveer still wants to review Sayed's C++ universal intrinsics PR to form a more informed opinion, but assuming that that looks good he leans towards an in-house solution.
