## Follow-up from last meeting / discussions

- [Draft NEP 54](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/24138/files) and [technical discussion](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/24084) is still not settled enough.
- For https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/24385 (static dispatch PR): Ralf to post a benchmark question; let's try to get this PR to be realistic representation of what the end result would look like. 
- Sayed provided a list of missing intrinsics in the proposed NEP 54.

- float16/bfloat16: should we have better support, e.g. as an external package providing bfloat16
  Raghuveer: not a short-term focus. Jan: bf16 quite useful for ML.
- SVML: Sayed started adding C code for 1ULP in a [PR to SVML](https://github.com/numpy/SVML/pull/5/files). Will continue to work on this and other functions.
- Raghuveer: prefer batch interface instead of returning single reg like SVML, because overhead at least for fp16 was high: compiler reloads tables inside the function, which is called multiple times from the batch loop. numpy is anyway going to process the entire batch.
- NEP 54: wait until all Highway ops added? No, better to plan ahead. There is a problem with the `_SIMD` module: it will be difficult to test the single Highway intrinsics without namespaces.
- Sayed: want to pass -mno-mmx flag, was necessary for compiler. Jan: OK to add such a flag.
- Jan: TODO is to add Unpredictable1 to add to Highway tests so compiler doesn't 'optimize out' test code
- https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/24018 - VQSort. should change to static dispatch. Highest priority, start with this first before thinking about other math/SIMD code.

## New topics

- Raghuveer prefers to keep an option to use x86-simd-sort now that it supports AVX2 and has some extra optimizations.

- Will accept Chris's vqsort PR as-is, and follow-up work by Raghuveer will split vqsort and x86-simd-sort into separate files. Also enable vqsort for non-Arm targets.

- Michael Siebert: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/23752. Discuss with seberg in review comments, maybe attend triage meeting where he might be present, or continue via review functions. Sayed thinks the approach is reasonable and will review.

- NEP 54: Matti currently unavailable, who should update the text? Idea is to merge soon with current status, without deciding everything SIMD-related.

- Chris requests decision on SIMD interface so that development can resume. Jan believes: group has no showstopper concerns about using Highway interface/naming in static dispatch mode. Sayed would have preferred a minimal interface, but similarly to other dependencies (BLAS libraries), numpy can use the subset it wants. Sounds like consensus to move ahead with this.

- Non-contiguous inputs must be supported in SIMD. Too slow to first copy into contiguous because most numpy functions are linear-time and memory-bound. Cannot use scalar fallbacks because want same numerical behavior / precision as SIMD code.

- Missing ops in Highway: can have wrapper function in numpy that calls existing universal intrinsics and puts them in Highway vectors. Helpful as a temporary bridge and to prototype code, goal would be to move all (missing from Highway) functionality into Highway.

## Action items
- Raghuveer: ask again to open-source SVML. Show PR#5 : going to happen anyway.

- Issue for testing unit for Highway to be able to develop kernels in Python. Raise issue in Highway to discuss. Short-term: can only implement the ops required by numpy, also allows prototyping numpy kernels. Mid-term goal could be to replace existing Highway tests. To be confirmed with other users: would it be OK to depend upon python?

- Raise issue for adding IBM zSystem target. Minimum is z14 vxe because it supports fp32, which is required by Highway. Sayed estimates 2 weeks of work; some similarity with VSX, though each is missing something of the other.
