**Present**: Ralf, Chris, Raghuveer, Sayed

## Follow-up from last meeting / discussions

- VQSort issues persists in Highway v1.1.0 (https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/25464)
    - Chris: Trying to re-produce locally, intermittent bugs are the worst
    - Sayed/Ralf: If we need to we can toggle VQSort off to unblock release

## New topics

- Reviving ([NEP 11 â€” Deferred UFunc evaluation](https://numpy.org/doc/1.13/neps/deferred-ufunc-evaluation.html)) as part of the array API standard


## Action items
- Issue for testing unit for Highway to be able to develop kernels in Python. Raise issue in Highway to discuss. Short-term: can only implement the ops required by numpy, also allows prototyping numpy kernels. Mid-term goal could be to replace existing Highway tests. To be confirmed with other users: would it be OK to depend upon python?


## Backlog
* [PRs and issues labelled with "SIMD"](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/labels/component%3A%20SIMD) (please add)

- float16/bfloat16: should we have better support, e.g. as an external package providing bfloat16
  Raghuveer: not a short-term focus. Jan: bf16 quite useful for ML.

- Leveraging more of Highway's pre-built functions
    - Dot / Matvec for none-f32/f64?
    - Ref: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/25675

- Intrinsics: Highway or C++ universal intrinsics?
    - discussion, some circling back to ground we covered before / in NEP 54
    - Trial underway with https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/25781
    - opinions:
        - Sayed prefers universal intrinsics in C++
        - Chris has some preference for Highway, worries about longer-term maintenance
            - Discussion did show that we should be good on SVE support (open PR for that already, which should work together with the testing module)
        - Raghuveer still wants to review Sayed's C++ universal intrinsics PR to form a more informed opinion, but assuming that that looks good he leans towards an in-house solution.
