**Code of Conduct**
The NumPy Steering Council has made a strong commitment to creating an open, inclusive, and positive community. 
All attendees of NumPy community events must adhere to the NumPy Code of Conduct (https://numpy.org/code-of-conduct/). 
If you see violations, take a screenshot, intervene in a respectful manner, and report it to the CoC Committee via email. For more information, refer to the Reporting Guidelines section on https://numpy.org/code-of-conduct/.


**Present**: Abhishek Kumar, Riley Rockwell, Jan Wassenberg 

## Follow-up from last meeting / discussions

- Discussed how to deal with dynamic dispatch in NumPy for future patches
    - HWY_ targets in NumPy: maybe disable SVE. AVX2 is fine. SSE4=SSE4.2+AES+CLMUL, not 4.1.
    - Highway Dynamic Dispatch

- Discussed converting `exp` and `log` to Highway
    - https://github.com/numpy/numpy/blob/main/numpy/_core/src/umath/loops_exponent_log.dispatch.c.src

- NEP 54 decision: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/26949. Add a "we decided to go with Highway for static dispatch, see xxx" and mark the NEP as accepted. 
    - Dynamic dispatch: second step. The `meson_cpu` code may not be easy to understand, but less magical than Highway's self-including headers. Neither option is ideal.


## New topics

- More NEON fixes found in vqsort in Highway - related to lack of masking and unsafe access on aarch64 (now fixed by Chris and Jan).

- https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/26956
  - No need to discuss here, this is just happening.
  - Raghuveer to take a look at 32-bit issues and see if it can be easily fixed
      - If not, it's not essential :smile_cat: 

- NumPy 2.0 AMA
When: Tuesday, August 6th at 12 pm ET / 4 pm UTC
Where: via Zoom https://numfocus-org.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_HRKnCdfhStW31Hc-LEnwfQ (Registration is required.)
Ask Me Anything (AMA) session with Nathan Goldbaum, a NumPy maintainer from Quansight Labs, to discuss the work on NumPy 2.0 and future direction of the project.






## Action items
- [name=r-devulap] to raise an issue for dispatch decision to gather all of the points together as well as whether to move to Google Highway

- Issue for testing unit for Highway to be able to develop kernels in Python. Raise issue in Highway to discuss. Short-term: can only implement the ops required by numpy, also allows prototyping numpy kernels. Mid-term goal could be to replace existing Highway tests. To be confirmed with other users: would it be OK to depend upon python?


## Backlog
* [PRs and issues labelled with "SIMD"](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/labels/component%3A%20SIMD) (please add)

- float16/bfloat16: should we have better support, e.g. as an external package providing bfloat16
  Raghuveer: not a short-term focus. Jan: bf16 quite useful for ML. Chris: would be good to get f16 and bf16 operands for MatMul; BLAS only supports f32 and f64.

- Leveraging more of Highway's pre-built functions
    - Dot / Matvec for none-f32/f64? 8..32-bit MatMul is currently in gemma.cpp.
    - Ref: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/25675

- Intrinsics: Highway or C++ universal intrinsics?
    - discussion, some circling back to ground we covered before / in NEP 54
    - Trial underway with https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/25781
    - opinions:
        - Sayed prefers universal intrinsics in C++
        - Chris has some preference for Highway, worries about longer-term maintenance
            - Discussion did show that we should be good on SVE support (open PR for that already, which should work together with the testing module)
        - Raghuveer still wants to review Sayed's C++ universal intrinsics PR to form a more informed opinion, but assuming that that looks good he leans towards an in-house solution.
