## Follow-up from last meeting / discussions

- [name=Mousius] How close are we with https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/25781/ ?
    - [linux_aarch64_test](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/25781/checks?check_run_id=24223563198) `../numpy/_core/src/highway/hwy/detect_targets.h:690:2: error: #error "Logic error: best baseline should be included in dynamic targets"`
    - [debug](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/actions/runs/8823342722/job/24223801464?pr=25781) - `Fatal Python error: Illegal instruction` in `test_sincos_overlaps`
    - [x86-64, LP64 OpenBLAS (MSVC)](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/actions/runs/8823342737/job/24223563550?pr=25781#logs) - `Fatal Python error: Aborted` in `test_sincos_overlaps`
    - [macos_arm64](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/actions/runs/8823342716/job/24223565003?pr=25781) - `../numpy/_core/src/umath/loops_trigonometric.dispatch.cpp:171:19: error: requested alignment is not a power of 2`
        - Fixable by using `hn::ExtractLane` rather than copying into aligned memory?
    - [s390x](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/actions/runs/8823342726/job/24223565841?pr=25781) / [s390x - baseline(Z13)](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/actions/runs/8823342726/job/24223565841?pr=25781#logs) - ULP is off in multiple tests
        - [name=Mousius] Disable s390x until Sayed has time to take a look at it?
    - [clang_sanitizers](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/actions/runs/8823342723/job/24223562755?pr=25781#logs) - just hanging, think is unrelated?

- [name=rgommers] number of CPU architecture-specific kernels to use for vendored `libopenblas.so`
      https://github.com/OpenMathLib/OpenBLAS/blob/develop/Makefile.system#L637-L667
  - AVX2 93.54% coverage per [Steam HW survey](https://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey/Steam-Hardware-Software-Survey-Welcome-to-Steam)


## Action items
- Issue for testing unit for Highway to be able to develop kernels in Python. Raise issue in Highway to discuss. Short-term: can only implement the ops required by numpy, also allows prototyping numpy kernels. Mid-term goal could be to replace existing Highway tests. To be confirmed with other users: would it be OK to depend upon python?


## Backlog
* [PRs and issues labelled with "SIMD"](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/labels/component%3A%20SIMD) (please add)

- float16/bfloat16: should we have better support, e.g. as an external package providing bfloat16
  Raghuveer: not a short-term focus. Jan: bf16 quite useful for ML.

- Leveraging more of Highway's pre-built functions
    - Dot / Matvec for none-f32/f64?
    - Ref: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/25675

- Intrinsics: Highway or C++ universal intrinsics?
    - discussion, some circling back to ground we covered before / in NEP 54
    - Trial underway with https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/25781
    - opinions:
        - Sayed prefers universal intrinsics in C++
        - Chris has some preference for Highway, worries about longer-term maintenance
            - Discussion did show that we should be good on SVE support (open PR for that already, which should work together with the testing module)
        - Raghuveer still wants to review Sayed's C++ universal intrinsics PR to form a more informed opinion, but assuming that that looks good he leans towards an in-house solution.
