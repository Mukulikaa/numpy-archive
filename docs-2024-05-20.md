## Follow-up from last meeting / discussions

- GSOD 2024 Updates:
    - Mars: coming back up to speed on process, page template, brushes
    - [Link to pages 12,13,14,15](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MarsBarLee/gsod-numpy-2023/main/Last%206%20pages.png)
    - [Link to page 16, 17](https://github.com/MarsBarLee/gsod-numpy-2023/blob/main/16,%2017.png?raw=true)
    - I think page 17 is a bit busy, but I was trying to fit the last parts of the script into the last page.
        - Half of page 18/back cover as ending, acts as a summary of comic, pointing out to NumPy Slack, mailing list and community call, along with credits
        - Gives more space for content on page 17, to take up space fully without feeling cramped
        - Create page 18/back cover 
    - [Script from last two pages, where it gets busy](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fjLTDqSkcKMxo8oSTRThllBFpjo5rXS9/edit#bookmark=id.4d34og8)
    - Does not include credits: perhaps text instead of illustration of short on time.
    - Comments on overview: happy how translated scrpit to visuals, accruate. Like how story ties together, leave with tips on how to interact with open source communities
    - POV changes, from PR maker to maintainer, humanize process
