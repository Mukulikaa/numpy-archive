### AGENDA
(*Feel free to add items for discussion to this agenda!*)

* Introductions (your name, a few words about your experience as a NumPy user/contributor, and a fun fact about you).

* Questions, comments, suggestions.


### MEETING NOTES

- Jules attended the in-person mentored sprint at PyConUS'23 hosted by Inessa. Interested in contributing to NumPy documentation, including tutorials.

- Mars: Hosting a brainstorming session for GSOD project at the next Newcomers Hour (May 18th, 2023)
    - Similar sessions to be held on May 8 and May 10
    - [Link to Google Jamboard](https://jamboard.google.com/d/1j_rEIslOh59N9cLGU1VGc7rTc88SuLTi7l4YqTqAULc/edit?usp=sharing)

- Feedback on User Profiles
        - "Migrating users", moving from Fortran or Julia or R to Python
        - When someone would use Fortran vs NumPy, especially for heavy computation
        - When someone would use Julia, especially useful in specific financial uses
        - Non-linear paths contributors can take
        - Learning to contribute to NumPy has it's own specifications, different from other projects, e.g. NumPy naming conventions

___

Take a survey at the end of the meeting (it will/should open in a new browser tab).
