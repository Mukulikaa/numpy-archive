**Code of Conduct**
The NumPy Steering Council has made a strong commitment to creating an open, inclusive, and positive community. 
All attendees of NumPy community events must adhere to the NumPy Code of Conduct (https://numpy.org/code-of-conduct/). 
If you see violations, take a screenshot, intervene in a respectful manner, and report it to the CoC Committee via email. For more information, refer to the Reporting Guidelines section on https://numpy.org/code-of-conduct/.

### AGENDA
(*Feel free to add items for discussion to this agenda!*)

* Introductions (your name, a few words about your experience as a NumPy user/contributor, and a fun fact about you).
    * Jost. Post-doc. 
        * Started using NumPy in PhD program to create an event generator for experiments in Astrophysics. [sntools](https://github.com/JostMigenda/sntools) is a Monte Carlo event generator for supernova neutrino interactions.
            * random module
        * Half slip into maintainer role for [SNEWPY: Supernova Neutrino Early Warning Models for Python](https://github.com/SNEWS2/snewpy)
            * Saw a PR for N-dimensional arrays for SNEWPY from someone who knows NumPy more, did not understand. Impressed and curious about NumPy
        * First time in any NumPy community call. Joined meeting because saw annoucement on Twitter 30 minutes before before the call.

* Questions, comments, suggestions.


### MEETING NOTES
* Do you like the new time for Newcomers?
* Learning Python as you go in an academic program
    * Physics undergrad program for Python has a 10 line example of what NumPy does
    * Picking up pieces to build what's needed, often without having a full picture
        * SNEWPY mostly has students, so their contributions are useful for themselves but may be a little piecemeal
        * NumPy community has contributors from a variety of domains to provide perspective
   
* How do you decide what fits in NumPy when NumPy is used so broadly?

___

Take a survey at the end of the meeting (it will/should open in a new browser tab).
