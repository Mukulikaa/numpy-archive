### MEETING NOTES
* Suggestion: move the time of the meeting to 4 pm UTC. 
Kai (Western Australia) and Teng (China) would like to keep this time slot or have another one that is friendlier to the APAC region (e.g., 12 pm UTC). Inessa will ask for more feedback from the community via Slack and mailing list.


* Invite Serge to speak about his work on C++ templates.

* Teng: follow up to the question on the mailing list: https://mail.python.org/archives/list/numpy-discussion@python.org/message/ZLP4HI2HPMAELFHHNNGZCIWU5SBULAQF/
___

Take a survey at the end of the meeting (it will/should open in a new browser tab).
