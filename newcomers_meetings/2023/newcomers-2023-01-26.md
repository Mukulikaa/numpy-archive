### AGENDA
(*Feel free to add items for discussion to this agenda!*)

* Introductions (your name, a few words about your experience as a NumPy user/contributor, and a fun fact about you).

* Questions, comments, suggestions.

### MEETING NOTES

- Zeeshan: I had a failing test `test_cpu_dispatcher`, is that an issue that I might face during my development?

- Zeeshan: There isn't a good first issue tag available on NumPy, can I get good issues that are beginner friendly?
Answer: look at the issues tagged as "sprintable": https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Asprintable

* Nuriel: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/23086
How-to-build docs:
