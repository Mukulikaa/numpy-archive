## New Topics

- Gathering community input for GSOD-NumPy 2023 with a 10 minute Brainstorming Session
    - [Link to Google Jamboard](https://jamboard.google.com/d/1j_rEIslOh59N9cLGU1VGc7rTc88SuLTi7l4YqTqAULc/edit?usp=sharing)
    - Main questions
        - What comments or concerns do you have about this project?
        - Based on your role in NumPy, what would your fantasy class be?
    - Can leave your comments on Jamboard after meeting as well
    - Discussion points
        - Fluidity of role
            - Instead of fixed roles, people can have percentage of skills or a skill build like Diablo 2
        - Guided vs unguided
            - guided: existing issues
            - unguided: nobody understand entire project, go with what your interested with
        - DnD might be western-centric but Fantasy concepts and classes are widely known
        - Quests
            - People complete quests together
            - Sprints as mini quests? Focused on smaller quests or "good first issues". So training for "main quest"
            - Issues and PRs as quests? We are NPCs?
            - People get interested in side-quests ("Ooh, what's over there?") which can be just as important as the 'main quest'. 
        - The Emotional Core
            - People brought together to complete a sprint, enjoy time and want to meet up again (returning contributors)
            - People come back because of welcoming community
        - Motiviation and characters
            - In pursuit of intellect: I want to know more
            - Curosity: Oh, what's over there?
            - The Wanderer: I don't know where I'm going and that's OK
            - The Boredom Buster: I don't want to write my thesis and this looker cooler
            - The Bug Killer: Squash. Them. All
            - The Lone Wolf: I will fix this in my fork and not share it upstream
            - Antihero Fame Seeker: NumPy is a big, important project and I want to make my mark!
        - Maintainers/community members as providing direction
            - Human guideposts on the map
            - Make suggestions, not dictating what to do
        - Responsibilty and weight of a big project
            - Downstream projects
        - Representation
            - How a community wants to be represented to other groups

- Inessa: Presentation by May Ireland, DEI consultant on the CZI DEI grant, at the PyConUS’23 Maintainers Summit on her findings from the discovery stage of developing a DEI action plan for four CZI-funded projects (NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, and pandas): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nno7B6jI0wY
