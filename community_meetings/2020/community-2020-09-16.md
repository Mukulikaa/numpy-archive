## Topics

- [NumPy Paper released](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2649-2) (please retweet, etc.)
    - Still 

- Sphinx 3 compatibility
  - Came out in April, still moving fast and breaking things
  - Debian has a small issue with it
  - don't use it for now, there is little new reasons.

- Distributing / pinning dependencies & setuptools

- Lots of changes right now in master creating issues:
  - Python3.8 and mypy has issues with the typing (tests run very slowly and then fail)
  - SIMD compilation changes make compiling things much slower

- Discussion about prioratization

- NetworkX has an interesting meeting setup:
  - Discussion about issues and then works on it together with others
  - A bit like pair programming (breakout into specific topics)
  - Try this format in the next triage meeting!

- Ryan and kubedoc started with GSoD.

- Distributing/setuptools status:
  - distutils is moved into setuptools (and changes will happen)
  - We pin setuptools low enough to not get the version that does this
  - After some time (e.g. a year) we try to make things work (when the dust has settled)
  - build dependencies (`pyproject.toml`) don't affect each other

- Generally an issue, if projects do not set an upper limit on the version things might have issues.
  - PIP is only now starting to actually check constraints (you can try it, but its not default)
  - Ralf will look into publicizing it (blog post)
