Looking for more mentors. If you are attending, sign up as a mentor during the registration process, or reach out directly to Inessa Pawson (via Slack or email). 
Mentor’s role description: to have a 30-min meeting with a mentee to advice on professional development. Mentors are encouraged to stay in touch with their mentees after the first meeting, but it’s not an obligation.

- SciPy tools plenary (and Sebastian has a talk).

- Complex numbers: Rakesh has send an email, it would be good to get a bit more feedback.

- `operator.concat` could be implemented for `np.ndarray`

- Sprint in July?
  - SciPy has a sprint.

- The docs meeting will probably be every two weeks from now on

- F2Py version issue https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/16525
  - We should probably just use the NumPy version, since it is in the repo
  - Pearu may have more time again in the future
