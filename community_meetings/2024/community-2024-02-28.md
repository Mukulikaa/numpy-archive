## Follow-up from the last meeting / discussions

_For the notes from the previous meeting, visit: https://github.com/numpy/archive/blob/main/community_meetings/community-2024-02-14.md_

- Review of [the NumPy 2.0 project board](https://github.com/orgs/numpy/projects/9/views/1)
  - Improve NumPy-Numba compatibility - nice to have, but not a blocker
  - https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/23999 - documentation is pending

- NumPy 2.0:
  - Chuck would like to prepare for branching
  - A few things are still open. The biggest points are:
    - Array API NEP 56 (and maybe implementation)
    - Breaking dtype struct
    - Exposing new dtype API
    - Hiding descriptors

- How to announce 2.0?
  - Put a link into the release notes
  - Blog post on scientific python (probably)
  - Slightly longer news article on numpy.org
  - Not in a hurry, final release is a while away.
  - We should try to add more links out from the release notes to docs.
  - Can also add a short snippet into the project readme "on github".

- [2.0 milestones](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%222.0.0+release%22) review

  - numpy.array_api was moved to a separate package for NumPy 2.0: https://pypi.org/project/array-api-strict/

- UMATH C++ interface a kiss of life from Marten, https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/19753.
  - Do we still need a NEP for the transition?
     - Sayed: we should move fast with merging the PR, without the NEP. 
     -  Mattip: since we already have solved many of the compiler availability and warning problems, I think there is not much of the change that is user-facing. So I don't think we need a NEP.
  -  When to merge? After the branching of NumPy 2.0
  -  Changing the signature of the inner loop is problematic, especially around dispatching. But Sayed suggests making the wrapper around the changed signature into be meta-objects that will mitigate much of the problem.

## New topics
- Can we create a JIT interface standard? Lazy/flushed (executed), multithreaded, caching, when to JIT compile? So far NumPy does not have lazy evaluation support. Maybe we should start with CopyOnWrite behaviour?
  - Which projects should we speak about it?
  - Ralf will follow up with Sayed. The conversation will continue at the next Optimization Team meeting on March 4th.
  
- Merging NEP 56 PR (https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/25542) with Draft status (mattip: that PR was merged) -> done!

- Interactive docs (plan: coming soon, a la https://github.com/scipy/scipy/issues/19729)
