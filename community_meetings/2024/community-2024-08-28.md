## New topics

- Uploading wheels from numpy-user-dtypes repo?
    - Should numpy-user-dtypes be "officially" supported?
    - Had a discussion about automating NumPy uploads and using trusted publishers.
    - Nathan explained Swayam Singh (Quansight Labs intern) wants to upload quaddtype wheels to enable experimentation. Needed because SLEEF is an annoying build dependency.
    - Matti offered to help out with the needed secret generation.

- Credit page for 'How to Contribute to NumPy comics
    - Adding a credits section to name the involved in making the .npz file type change (Ross, Ganesh, Chuck, Sebasitian)
    - The comic story is based on this .npz change
    - To resolve narrative problem: "based on a true story"
    - Community Review #3 coming up, in September
