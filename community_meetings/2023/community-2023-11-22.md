- Array API changes PRs open


- Cyclic garbage collection?
  - The hook used for it, would also be useful for string allocation management.

- Dropping Python 3.10:
  - Not yet, there is probably little gain anyway.


- Thoughts on new array conversion API (guessing internal for now):
  * still looking into this, but got a bit distracted with other things (and the whole wrapping)


## New topics

- Discussion about array API PRs:
  - `np.bool` and testing one should.
> [] ?
testing one should  - Let's add to the NEP that we move out `numpy.array_api` into its own package/repo. Especially if the main namespace is already compliant, there isn't much of a reason to have the separate namespace inside numpy.

- Would it be OK to make NEP 50 the only default (can start cleaning up a lot, might unlock some options also)?
  - Let's do if it becomes a real problem.

- f2py changes/failures/backports
  - bunch up f2py changes (maybe even copy it in a single commit from main).
  - Next 1.26.x will be an "f2py" release.

- Merge Highway Quick-sort pr https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/24018
    - Yes, all good. Let's go ahead with the merge, this supports Highway's high-level kernels.

- Supporting loongson[^loongarch] architecture (LSX)
  https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/25215
    - Has QEMU support since QEMU 7.1
    - Sayed is fine with adding it, as long as they support it. Others agree.

- Removing `PyArray_GetCastFunc`
  - PR: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/25161

- Building/developing docs:
    - Remove "Git for development" section?
    - Trimming down https://numpy.org/devdocs/dev/index.html (it looks quite poor and hard to navigate)
    - Adding a mostly 1:1 copy of http://scipy.github.io/devdocs/building/index.html 

- Separating out `libnpymath`; also undoing the C++ addition there.
    
- dealing with git submodules:
    - `git config --global submodule.recurse true`
    - parallel fetch: `git config --global fetch.parallel 0`

https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/15457
- Really old but useful F2PY PR :)

## Action items

- **LoongArch** is a new RISC ISA, which is a bit like MIPS or RISC-V. There are currently 3 variants: a reduced 32-bit version (LA32R), a standard 32-bit version (LA32S) and a 64-bit version (LA64). There are 4 privilege levels (PLVs) defined in LoongArch: PLV0~PLV3, from high to low. Kernel runs at PLV0 while applications run at PLV3. This document introduces the registers, basic instruction set, virtual memory and some other topics of LoongArch. â€” https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v6.4-rc7/loongarch/introduction.html
