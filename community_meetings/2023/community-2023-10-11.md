## Follow-up from the last meeting / discussions

_For the notes from the previous meeting, visit: https://github.com/numpy/archive/blob/main/community_meetings/community-2023-09-27.md_
- Starting to make ABI breaks
  - there is some header cleanup we could do to move us closer to the limited API. There are some non-limited API uses in the public headers, and these should be hidden so that cython users can do `cimport numpy` with the limited API.

- Numpy 2.0 API migration continues
    - `core` to `_core` rename
    - Direct import of `core` will continue to work to support pickle.

## New topics

- `core.submodule` will still be directly importable to avoid the warnings on pickling after the noticeable push-back on the mailing list.
  - `_core` stays around.
  - New pickle files will use new names, so will break on <1.26.x

- BLAS/LAPACK detection ([gh-24893](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/24893)) & NumPy 1.26.1 release
    - Leaving `allow-noblas` at `false` for this release to ensure that we get reports if anything is not working, rather than silent performance regressions.
    
- Presentation about GSOD NumPy Project is accepted to the PyData NYC program.
    - '[Comics in NumPy? More Likely than You Think!](https://nyc2023.pydata.org/cfp/talk/MTUFNQ/)' on Nov 2 2023, 10:55â€“11:35am, Microsoft Conference Center
    - Aim to hand out rescoped comics with 10/16 pages

- Remove upper version pin on Python?
  - Decision: Yes, we should remove them.

- Working around uint > -1
  - Started via `resolve_dtypes_raw` which is passed the info: bunch of hacks and lots of templates, but will work...

- NumPy finance review meeting is moved to November 2023.

- Cirrus CI costs:
  - About one month for about $45 (NumPy), SciPy spend $17 for half a month.

- `intp` as default integer discussion (64bit on 64bit machiens, 32bit on 32bit). Should we remove `np.int_` "default integer" and tell users to use `intp`?

  - Decision: change the definition of `intp` to be an `ssize_t`.
