- Inessa: NumPy 2.0 meeting retrospective
Meeting notes: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vNDBlnVCJM-Nv7xF02Re4qk_5rR9uAUi0ih6K3b2YAE/edit?usp=sharing


## New Topics

* Discussion about documenting 64bit -> `intp` casts in certain functions

* Discussion about NumPy 2.0 followup.

* Discussion about `arange`
  * Maybe it is time to do something, but it should probably only kick in rarely (i.e. only in cases where we know the current result is odd)

* Tim Bonnemann (IBM OSSci): https://opensource.science
  - NumFOCUS is hiring Open Source Science Program Manager for this program
(https://numfocus.medium.com/now-hiring-78e8bd19aadf)

* `numpy.ma`: okay to mark as legacy in the docs. There's no 100% replacement, so we can't deprecate it despite all the issues it has.
