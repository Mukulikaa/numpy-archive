**Code of Conduct**
The NumPy Steering Council has made a strong commitment to creating an open, inclusive, and positive community. 
All attendees of NumPy community events must adhere to the NumPy Code of Conduct (https://numpy.org/code-of-conduct/). 
If you see violations, take a screenshot, intervene in a respectful manner, and report it to the CoC Committee via email. For more information, refer to the Reporting Guidelines section on https://numpy.org/code-of-conduct/.


**Present:** Sebastian, Raghuveer, Inessa, St√©fan van der Walt, Mike McCarty, Michael Siebert, Sayed, Chuck



## Follow-up from the last meeting / discussions

_For the notes from the previous meeting, visit: https://github.com/numpy/archive/blob/main/community_meetings/community-2023-05-24.md_

- Sayed Adel: Next move towards C++ support, there's a lot of SIMD work depending on it.
    - Two choices: SVE support from C++ (will require C++ ufuncs), or add sizeless support in universal SIMD.
        - option 2: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/22265
        - option 1 (preferred by Sayed):
            - https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/21057
            - https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/19753
    - Either way it does/should not affect anyone externally.
    - Internal vs. external signatures will diverge more if internal is in C++ and external in C.
    - Inner loops for custom dtypes will still be able to be written in C, like now (so no backwards compatibility breaks for C API users).
    - NEP: C++ support in the ufunc machinery.
    - Sayed will write a summary of why the ufunc machinery needs C++ parts going forward. After that is done, we'll judge if it needs to be a full NEP (Ralf agrees to help writing if needed).
    - C++17 version is much better and lower-complexity than the older implementation that Sayed had.




## New Topics

- Discussion about sin/cos precision
  - [name=Raghuveer] Suggested to use lower precision for float32 but high accuracy for float64.

- SPEC discussion (endorsement)
  - https://scientific-python.org/specs/
  - Mainly 0 (replacing NEP 29) and 4 (CI infra) are interesting, a bit of history may be good.

- Changing string casts to bool
  - `np.asarray(["0", "1"]).astype(bool)` is currently ``[False, True]`` does it seem OK to change that to `[True, True]` (i.e. the `0`) for NumPy 2.0 or should it even then have.
      - Can lead to silently bad results 
      - old behavior: `np.asarray(["0", "1"]).astype(int).astype(bool)`
      - We can probably just change it for 2.0

- Context manager to control precision
