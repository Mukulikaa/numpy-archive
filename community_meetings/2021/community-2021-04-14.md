    - Add one-pager to https://github.com/numpy/archive


- NumPy finances review meeting next week
    - Sayed received IBM bounty last month (it took a while).

- Template engine for Sayed, is there an alternative solution? PR is 4 months old.
    - Sayed thinks it's important, other template engines don't even give you line numbers.
    - C++11 would be better, and now that Python 2.7  is dropped we can use it.
    - There are lots of upsides, so let's do it!

- Accessibility Discussion - Review of NumPy Documentation and Website
    - Aiming to do one audit by external expert on what's most important to make the documentation is more accessible.
    - Melissa and Mars working on an community roadmap for website + docs accessibility.
    - Eventually open discussion on NumPy mailing list
    - Two categories of issues: theme related (e.g., color contrast) and therefore repeating, and one-off issues.

- Tentative dates for an AMMI/Scientific Python workshop: June Thurs/Fri 3rd-4th
  * rossbar will set up a website soon - stay tuned

- Reminder: NumPy WiMLDS sprint on May 9th. Help with preparing issues beforehand & PR review on the day will be very welcome.
