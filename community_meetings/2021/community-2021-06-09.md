## Follow-up from last meeting / discussions


## Topics

* NumPy’s participation in the [SPEC process](https://scientific-python.org/specs/purpose-and-process/)
  - PR due 6/9
  - Nothing to lose :).

* Please record meeting for those who can't attend, if speakers are OK with it
  * Note: We only plan to make it available on request, not post it publically, and will cut it down if necessary to protect anyone from the audience.

* This meeting will be dedicated to a presentation by Matthew Rahtz and Pradeep Kumar Srinivasan, and Discussion about Tensor typing!

    Title: **Better types for numerical computing - arrays generic in dtype and shape**

    Abstract: An overview of why more detailed types for arrays would be awesome, the work being done to enable those types in [PEP 646](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0646/), and what the future of this effort could look like.

  - Tensor typing meetings happen monthly and are planned on [typing-sig](https://mail.python.org/archives/list/typing-sig@python.org/) The next one is [July 7th](https://mail.python.org/archives/list/typing-sig@python.org/thread/LQTBZN4VP243JJBEFXWNU5EDTEH3XOKG/)

* Remove non-public objects from `__all__`?
