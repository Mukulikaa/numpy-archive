## Follow-up from last meeting / discussions

- Survey status (391)
  - Another twitter call might bring another larger amount (retweet)
  - Conferences? PyData, but only in October
  - Less responses but very good data


## Topics

* 1.21.2 released :tada:

* There was another note to be careful about the SVML precision, do we need to think more on it?!
  - Ongoing discussion, continue on the mailing list.
  - Post the speed/precision trade-off summary to the mailing list, maybe it helps in the discussion.

- Releasing 3.10 wheels?
  - oldest support NumPy needs updating for M1

- Python 3.7 dropped
  - removed PyPy for now, should be out in a month.
  - The "old" pypy main is there
  - users who use PyPy should probably use conda-forge
  - Will unblock array-api work, etc.
 
- Translation: 
    - Status of Brazilian translation (done but review maybe not)
    - Chinese also done
    - not yet public

- Doxygen docs from C headers work by Sayed
  - Probably best to put it in (somewhere) to make it easier to push better C docs forward.
