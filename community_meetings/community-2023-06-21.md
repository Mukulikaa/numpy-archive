- Inessa: YouTube videos update: Jules Kouatchou (@JulesKouatchou) has provided timestamps for 4 videos.:tada:

- First big removals in the C-API, two new tags `python_removal`, `c_api_removals`

- A huge amount of work on https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/21057
  - doxygen used for documentation (should land in the build artifacts)
  - Will be split up into multiple PRs (e.g. split out testing)
  - Supports sizeless SIMD
  - [before](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/blob/main/numpy/core/src/umath/loops_comparison.dispatch.c.src) and [after](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/blob/1bd85d3bdc62141aaa98d338beda01f7f6602ff3/numpy/core/src/umath/loops_comparison.dispatch.cpp)

-  Mars: I'm not in this call, so here's written update: At **Writing Script, Thumbnailing stage** for GSOD-NumPy 2023
 

## New Topics

- Introductions from Chris (ARM) and Jan (Google)
  -  SIMD / [Google Highway](https://github.com/google/highway)
  - Adopting Google Highway would require a NEP. 
  - If we decide not to adopt it, we'll write a summary about this decision and devise an alternative plan.


## Action Items

- Matti P. will write the first draft of the summary of today's discussion.
