## Follow-up from the last meeting / discussions

## New Topics

- Documentation artifact link broke due to the permission changes for the OSSF security card.
   

- Sebastian: Should we move this meeting time? 
  - Let's create a http://whenisgood.net poll to see if one time slot is clearly better.

- Sebastian: Remove the Google community calendar.  (If no complains, will remove all events, and add a single full day event that the calendar is not being used anymore.)
  - Inessa will take charge of this (Sebastian had talked to her before.)

- Does "casting safety" make sense to you for values, lets say `np.array([1.0, 100], dtype=int, casting="safe")` existed, what should happen? `np.can_cast(int, "int8", casting="same_kind")`.
  - If you would allow "safe" for floats, that seems weird.



## Standing topics

- Inessa: Presentation topics for NumPy Newcomersâ€™ Hour 
To suggest a topic for future presentations, leave a comment in this tracking issue: https://github.com/numpy/archive/issues/58.

- Inessa & Melissa: Documentation user stories (https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/22089)
