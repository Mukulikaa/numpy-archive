            - Debuted at PyData NYC 2019
            - Digital, has [Twitter](https://twitter.com/codespritee) and Medium precense
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/XIj4Laj.png)
    - Possible grants
        - [NUMFocus: Small Development Grants](https://numfocus.org/programs/small-development-grants)
            - Round 3 (maybe too soon, due on Sept 2) or next year 
        - CZI
            - Interest from [Dario's tweet, CZI](https://twitter.com/ReaderMeter/status/1547250705521643522?s=20&t=BRltiD0m-KCHvRBXMzUbSw)
        - GSoD as well
            - It is more technical than our last proposal, so it should have more of leg to stand on
    - Interested parties
        -  Educators
            -  Met at SciPy 2022 conference, US high school teachers, college professors, who want to photocopy their SciPy comic and give to their students
        -  Open Source Design
            -  Talked about in August's OSD Call. [Link to my OSD agenda for the call](https://discourse.opensourcedesign.net/t/monthly-open-source-design-call/253/148)
            -  OSD community interested in how Mars knowledge in comic making can be open source as well
        -  Rohit
    -  Questions and Concerns
        -  Clarifying the design process
            - [Script and early sketch process](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15tv6rHUG7z_kM68rwl2m-Gkce8cP_AEt1aJhzdi7Vnw/edit#bookmark=id.s77y5mc5h2hj), shows people the process, comment with feedback
        - Level of detail
            - Images take more time than plain text
    - Moving forward with Small Development Grant
        - Grants proposal need to be specific: which part of the documentation?
        - For example, [strides](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.ndarray.strides.html)?
        - Absolute Beginners?
        - 700 words of details, 400 words of impact, 1000 words overall
        - Decide target audience
            - People who already know Python and exploring data?
                - Know lists, array, attribute
                - Don't know how to make things fast
            - ML, what are these matrices people are talking about? Have math background but no programming background
        - Educators: High school? if college, get Python somewhere else
            - Take advantage of print comics, educators who want to photocopy their SciPy comic and give to their students
            - Teachers are a connection to a group who may not have reached
            - If US highschoolers (14-18), may not know matrixes
            - If it's a sophmore taking pre-calc, perfect time for NumPy to be introduced
            - Inessa, AlbusCode, high schoolers, can have focus group
            - Concern: are comics relevant in younger generation? Yes
        - Maybe similar focus to [James Munroe on SciPy Lectures discussion](https://hackmd.io/oB_boakvRqKR-_2jRV-Qjg?view):  After newcomers complete the first tutorial,they think ‘why continue with this tool?’. How does this replace my current tool?
        - [name=Mars] Working adults have SciPy Lectures, college students have Ryan Cooper, high schoolers have these comics. Introduce NumPy to younger group
        - Grant intent: not just a comic, but comic to be used by specific people, why useful for this specific group. 
        - 700 words on the overview and 400 words on impact, and budget, timeline, contributor in mind, and a catchy title
        - Specific group: a specific high school district, make focus groups, attach to high school curriculum and semester schedule
        - Present output at exhibit? Multiple possible tie-ins
        - [ ] Mars to follow-up with Inessa

            
- [name=Inessa] Updating [SciPy Lectures](https://github.com/scipy-lectures/scipy-lecture-notes)          
    - Follow-up with discussion with James Munroe and Jan 2022 discussion of updating SciPy Lectures
    - Stages of SciPy Lectures updates
        - 1. Infastructure
        - 2. Content
    - Checking in with reviewer's bandwidth
        - James, Ross, 
        - Brigatta offers help with the infrasturcture
    - Adding sphinx-gallery? Or switching to the executable books/MyST-nb tool stack.
        - Ross and Brigitta has experience in implementing
