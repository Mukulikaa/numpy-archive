- [name=inessa] Presentation topics for NumPy Newcomersâ€™ Hour 
To suggest a topic for future presentations, leave a comment in this tracking issue: https://github.com/numpy/archive/issues/58.
    - Nov 17th, 8pm UTC - Ross presenting on maintainig the NumPy Tutorials repo

- [name=Inessa & Melissa] [Documentation user stories](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/22089)
*(Feel free to add yours!)*

- Updates from the NumFOCUS Project Summit
  - [x] Inessa has shared her notes via email 
  - Different groups exploring refguide check vs pytest-based approach
      - built-in tools, different speeds

- Ralf: plan to implement some [OSSF security scorecard](https://github.com/ossf/scorecard) improvements that are relevant for NumPy
  - PR 22367 added permissions to the github actions, but broke the circleCI artifact link and the labelbot, so permissions were reverted for the labelling job in PR 22371. I opened issues on the upstream action providers.
  - Examples: branch protections, dependencies check
  - Some are already implemented, irrelevant or chosen to implement differently from OSSF
  - Do we have an official security policy?
      - NumPy's README.md links to [Tidelift](https://tidelift.com/docs/security), make report on Tidelift
      - OSSF recommends standalone SECURITY.md file
      - [x] Add SECURITY.md to NumPy with same instructions as READ.md: "Report a security vulnerability: https://tidelift.com/docs/security"
      - numpy.org has a [security page](https://numpy.org/devdocs/reference/security.html)

  - *Update*
      - PR opened
      - NumPy has pilot project for OSSF: what does that entail?


- Setting up OpenCollective 
  - Finance team has to look into this.

- Craig Peters (GitHub): demo of Codespaces

Share feedback, including feature requests, with Craig via NumPy Slack
      
- Discussion of Github Copilot (AI pair programmer) and open source licenses
  - Uncertainty of given code's source and license

  - NumPy.org website to mention that it is trademarked?
      - In Fair Use NEP? 
      - In README? The landing page for most people
      - In [terms of use page](https://numpy.org/terms/)?
      - [ ] [name=Sebastian] Ask NumFOCUS where to put it


## New Topics

- Melissa: New schedule for NumPy documentation team meetings
  - Move it to two hours later
  - To address this comment (https://mail.python.org/archives/list/numpy-discussion@python.org/message/DMLHUAS7P32CHE3DDVRFZWYYES6ZPQYH/), move to an alternating schedule. 
  - Initial proposal: 4PM UTC and 12PM UTC

- [name=seberg] Changing NumPy scalar repr's?
  - [NEP](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/22261) and [implementation](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/22449) are largely updated (hopefully settled besides doc followup and new tests)
    - Questions:
      - How to print NaN's, currently: `np.float64(nan)`, could use `np.float64(np.nan)` or `np.float64('nan')` to make it copy-pastable.  But, even Python just prints 'nan' and 'inf'!
      - Any other wishes/concerns, or should we merge the NEP and officially propose it?
          - complex numbers
      - How should implementation move forward?  Can we try for NumPy 1.24?  Aim for just after that?  Look into making it optional in 1.24?
        - Doing it after gives people time to fixup things and test
        - From a NEP 50 adoption perspective it probably doesn't matter, since there won't be a deprecation period, so next release is just as well.  (And NEP 50 switch would be earliest that release)
        - Seems like: Get it accepted soon, put it in right after release.
     - `np.void((1, 2, 3), dtype=...)`
