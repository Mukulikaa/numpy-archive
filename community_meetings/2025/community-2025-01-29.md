## Follow-up from the last meeting / discussions

- Petr asked if we want to write a PEP about allowing custom DType definitions in the buffer protocol format (by abusing/etending format):
  - Yes, Sebastian and Nathan would want to but have to see when time comes around.

- Setting up CI for windows arm may be possible now.
  - flang is available for openblas and f2py tests


## New topics

- A few new mypy only issues: redirected to MyPy.

- Shape type meeting summary (there are PEP drafts around that, but it is still in an early phase, with two approaches and neither were convincing to Eric Traut).

- New repo to develop typing stubs outside of NumPy: https://github.com/jorenham/numtype
  - move to `numpy` GitHub org at some point
  - We should look into names e.g. `numpy-stubs` and liberate the project on PyPI (since it seems reserved, potentially by us).
